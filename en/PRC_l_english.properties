CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC코0=Once the most powerful nation on the face of the Earth, China has been brought low by nearly a century of western imperialism and internal strife.\n\nChiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, the central government of China, now face threats from both the Japanese Empire, which has already annexed a vast swath of China, and Mao’s Communists, who are currently holed up in the hills of Shaanxi. Surrounded on all sides, Chiang now prepares China for a war the likes of which the country has never seen.
PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC코0=The Chinese Communist Party is on the brink of destruction. After a failed revolution, Communist armies have been broken on all fronts by the KMT, the Communists fled from their bases in southern China to their new base in Shaanxi. From this catastrophe, a new leader emerged for the party: Mao Zedong.\n\nMao brings with him a radical new vision of communism, and a new strategy for survival and expansion. Perhaps the Communists could ally with their former enemies against a greater foe…
PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC코0=In chaos there is opportunity. The Japanese invasion has forced the KMT, who in 1936 had come incredibly close to extinguishing the CCP, now have been forced to ally with the Communists.\n\nNow, the Communists have waited in Shaanxi, content to let the KMT do the majority of the fighting. Perhaps, through this war, the Communists could advance and take the Northern provinces of China, long since lost to the Japanese. Perhaps, after the war's end, the Communists could use the industry of the North to drive South and deal a crushing blow to the KMT. Perhaps...
CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC코0=The Japanese invasion has been brutal. Ploughing through defenses around Beijing and Shanghai, the Japanese swept into the capital at Nanjing and committed acts of unspeakable horror within its walls. And yet, to the world's amazement, China fights on.\n\nChiang, from his new capital in Chongqing, leads the resistance against Japan. In the mountainous terrain of the interior, Chinese armies, their hearts filled with vengeance, charge Japanese forces, determined to drive the devils back into the sea. If China has to pay the blood price for her freedom, then so be it.
