grl.1코0=The Hull-Kauffmann agreement
grl.1.t코0=The Hull-Kauffmann agreement
grl.1.d코0=The Danish government has recently fallen to fascist armies, but the colonial territory of Greenland remains free from fascist interference. Conveniently a Danish diplomat by the name of Henrik Kauffmann has recently approached us has approached us regarding the Greenland situation. Acting in ‘in the Name of the King’ and of the authority of the recently exile Danish government. Kauffmann is ready to sign over control of Greenland to us. The officials in Nuuk have contacted Kauffmann with this request because they would prefer American occupation instead of possible occupation by either [ENG.getnameDEF] or [CAN.getnameDEF]. Or even worse... a fascist power. This agreement may be legally dubious in regard to international law. But we have a responsibility to protect all land and the people of the New World from the Fascist threat, this includes Greenland. Though how should we go about this?
grl.1.a코0=Put Greenland under our direct control immediately.
grl.1.b코0=Let local government in Nuuk take control. Though we'll need to ensure their safety.
