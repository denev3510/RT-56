nippon_events.67.d코0=[MEN.GetLeader]'s pro-Japanese attitude has been worrying, his defection to the Japanese is just a matter of time. If he defect to the Japanese with his current power, our Inner Mongolian region will be under Japanese control entirely and would give them advantage if we are at war.\n\nSome of the officials in [Root.GetRulingParty] has called for an action to weaken [MEN.GetLeader]'s power by splinting [MEN.GetNameDEF] and restraint his power to only the Cahar region.

nippon_events.71.d코0=The recent action of the [CHI.GetRulingParty] has caused some discontent within the [MEN.GetName]. Our relationship has been close with [MEN.GetLeader], maybe we can use this opportunity to further weaken the Chinese?
nippon_events.71.a코0=Anything that can give us an advantage in the upcoming war.

Their actions have caused disturbance among our people. If they do not practice a more moderate method of spreading their propaganda, we will soon catch the Japanese's attention and the entire plan will be at risk.
nippon_events.78.a코0=Let them continue their practice.
nippon_events.78.b코0=Tell them to calm down.
nippon_events.79.t코0=[MAN.GetLeader]'s Petty Scheme
nippon_events.79.d코0=Our investigators have found solid evidence about [MAN.GetLeader]'s petty scheme of his to break away from our control.

nippon_events.81.t코0=Monarchism Ideas Taught in Schools
nippon_events.81.d코0=Some schools in our realm have started teaching students with monarchism ideas secretly.

nippon_events.81.b코0=Called for a stop of such practice.
nippon_events.82.t코0=Anti-Japanese Assemblies
nippon_events.82.d코0=Assemblies aimed at driving out the Japanese have started at some areas in our nation. Some have even turned into conflicts between pro-Japanese and anti-Japanese citizens. Although these assemblies might cause some damage to properties, they might be useful to our plan. However, not reacting at all would mean disloyalty to the Japanese.

nippon_events.83.t코0=Politicians Dislike Japanese
nippon_events.83.d코0=Some politicians have shown disgust towards Japanese. Those Japanese officials within our government have been target of attacks and blackmailing.

These actions have caused unrest and chaos among our army and even some armed conflict between our men and the Kwantung Army. If we are to prevent these conflicts to happen again, the most effective way is to remove all Japanese influence in our military. However, such practice would definitely provoke the Japanese.
nippon_events.84.a코0=Ban Japanese from participating any military affairs of our nation!
nippon_events.84.b코0=Those who are behind these mutinous actions will face court martial.
nippon_events.85.t코0=Japanese Killed

These incidents have caused some uproars of the Japanese communities within our nation as they complain about the lack of security they felt living here.

The number of guerrilla groups is still increasing and they might reach a point that the Japanese will need to hold a large scale military operation to completely root them out. If these guerrilla fighters are captured, we might risk being exposed to have connection with them.
nippon_events.87.a코0=Allow the guerrilla to expand.
nippon_events.87.b코0=For safety's sake, halt their expansion.
nippon_events.88.t코0=Vandalism Against Japanese
nippon_events.88.d코0=Anti-Japanese fanatics have been vandalizing Japanese properties recently, including stores, houses and event factory machineries.

nippon_events.89.t코0=Bold Proposal
nippon_events.89.d코0=In a recent meeting of the restorationists, one of them has proposed a bold plan to spread the restorationist idea even further and faster.

nippon_events.91.d코0=A member of the restorationist underground movement has been freaking our at meetings lately. He keeps stating that the Japanese might be aware of our plan now and we should stop this once and for all. His lack of faith in the movement aside, other members now start to worry about him disclose our plan to Japanese authority to save his own life, and is considering to dispose of him.
nippon_events.91.a코0=Let's try to convince him first.
nippon_events.91.b코0=Get rid of him, silently.
nippon_events.92.t코0=Secret Meeting Busted
nippon_events.92.d코0=A secret meeting has been busted when a Japanese police officer walked into the room where the restorationists were discussing their future plans. The officer was soon dispatched by the restorationists in sight and fled from the scene before more policemen arrive. However, the body of the officer was found out and some documents about the movement was left behind at the scene. This lead to the Japanese suspecting the existence of a underground restorationist group. If we instruct some members of the movement to turn themselves in for the greater good, their suspicion might fade away in time.
nippon_events.92.a코0=We will never give up on our comrades!
nippon_events.92.b코0=Success requires sacrifices.

nippon_events.94.a코0="I have no idea what you are talking about..."
nippon_events.94.b코0="These conspirators have contacted me before but I have refused their offers..."
nippon_events.95.t코0=Stalkers?
nippon_events.95.d코0=[Root.GetLeader] is now starting to suspect that there are stalkers from Tokyo monitoring his daily life even tighter. Even some members of the movement have reported that they are being followed and numerous meetings have to be canceled due to key figures cannot arrive at the meeting location. The stalkers sure are a threat to our plan, however we can deploy decoys to distract the stalkers to reduce to risk of being discovered.
nippon_events.95.a코0=We just need to be more careful, decoys are unnecessary and costly.
nippon_events.95.b코0=A sound plan.
nippon_events.96.t코0=Tapped Phones
nippon_events.96.d코0=Some key figures have reported that their phones are tapped. Most believe it to be the work of Japanese agents. Many of them have switched to writing letters instead of communicating on the phone. This has drastically slowed down the progress of the movement.
nippon_events.96.a코0=Tell them to keep using the phone.
nippon_events.96.b코0=We should be more cautious.
