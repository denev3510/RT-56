MAL_the_empire코0=The Empire
MAL_the_empire_desc코0=Autonomy? Nationalism? Self-Determination? What this colony REALLY needs is a firm hand, a steady grip, and stiff upper lip, by Jove!
MAL_the_empire_1코0=Resident Generals
MAL_the_empire_1_desc코0=The Resident Generals are the key to controlling Malaysia, if we can bolster their already considerable powers and sideline the local rulers, we can solidify our hold on the colony for years to come.
MAL_the_empire_2코0=Open the Civil Service
MAL_the_empire_2_desc코0=Playing the locals off of each other has worked well so far, but in the long-term, such a clearly undemocratic system will cause more problems than its worth, opening government roles to all malaysian citizens is the right thing to do.
MAL_the_empire_3코0=Reinforce Ketuan Melayu
MAL_the_empire_3_desc코0=Any attempt to change the status quo will only result in more trouble for us than its worth. Instead, let's reaffirm our committment to Ketuan Melayu, and shore up support amongst the Malay natives.
MAL_the_empire_4코0=Dethrone the Princes
MAL_the_empire_4_desc코0=The last refuge of native control, the Council of Princes has been a useful tool in ruling from afar in our colony, but no longer. Now we shall rule as we see fit, with no petty squabbling princes to get in our way.
MAL_the_empire_5코0=The Pearl of the East
MAL_the_empire_5_desc코0=Singapore remains the heart of British Asian control, linking the British concessions in China to our far-flung Pacific dominions. We should celebrate this fact, and turn singapore into the greatest city of Southeast Asia!
MAL_the_empire_6코0=Commonwealth Research Benefits
MAL_the_empire_6_desc코0=With our committment to the empire reaffirmed, we can begin to enjoy the benefits of such loyalty through the relaying of scientific breakthroughs and their implementation in our own colony.

MAL_the_empire_7_desc코0=England calls for aid! And every loyal citizen of the empire in Malaya will answer, for God and country!

MAL_the_workers_1코0=Anti-Japanese Recruitment
MAL_the_workers_1_desc코0=It's no secret that Japan wants to swap one colonial overlord for another, and with the neglect that current military policy has in safeguarding our country, this could indeed come to pass, if we are to protect our freedom, the defense of Malaysia must be taken up by the common people.
MAL_the_workers_2코0=Chinese Support
MAL_the_workers_2_desc코0=The Chinese communists represent the closest friend we have in the worker's revolution, and we share a common enemy, if their revolution succeeds, we will have a powerful ally in securing our freedom.
MAL_the_workers_3코0=Comintern Support
MAL_the_workers_3_desc코0=The soviets are a powerful force for communist revolution, but are mostly uninterested in affairs outside of their own sphere. However, even a small amount of support will legitimise our regime in the eyes of the people.
MAL_the_workers_4코0=The Emergency
MAL_the_workers_4_desc코0=The Japanese are here! This is our moment, brothers and sisters, let the Malaysian Revolution begin!
MAL_the_workers_5코0=The Revolution, Triumphant!
MAL_the_workers_5_desc코0=Against all odds, against all enemies, we have faced down the giants of imperialism, and survived, let our victory be a spark that ignites revolution in all of Asia!
MAL_the_workers_6코0=Kaum Buruh, Bersatu!
MAL_the_workers_6_desc코0=We owe it to the world to fight against imperialism wherever it can be fought, in doing this, we will spread this spark further afield, until all the workers of the world are free!
MAL_the_workers_7코0=Socialism in One Malaysia
MAL_the_workers_7_desc코0=Actually, maybe that spark can stay here.
MAL_status_quo코0=Status Quo
MAL_status_quo_desc코0=Change? Who needs change?
MAL_state_of_malaya코0=The State of Malaya
MAL_state_of_malaya_desc코0=The State of Malaya
MAL_centralisation코0=Centralisation
MAL_centralisation_desc코0=Under the current political system, the power of the governor to exert any kind of control over the colonies is nonexistent, if we are to reform the colony, we need to centralise our power under the a strong state authority.
MAL_centralisation_1코0=Economic Restructuring
MAL_centralisation_1_desc코0=Too much of the current economic power in the region is squandled by competing producers and market manipulation by private interests. To combat this, we need to first restructure Malaya's economy to allow for state regulation and protection of the markets.
MAL_centralisation_2코0=Nationalise the Plantations
MAL_centralisation_2_desc코0=Rubber plantations make up the largest amount of our national exports, but only a small amount of these profits are returned to the state, if we can nationalise some of the underperforming and smaller plantations, we can pave the way for further control of our foreign market exports.
MAL_centralisation_3코0=Renegotiate Foreign Investments
MAL_centralisation_3_desc코0=Our status as a colony means that we will always have a large amount of our resources tied up in foreign interests, but if we are to achieve any long-term financial success, the control and influence of these foreign assets need to be renegotiated back to our favour.
MAL_decentralisation코0=Decentralisation
MAL_decentralisation_desc코0=The real cause of our political strife lies in colonial bureaucracy and elite privileges hampering our progress, by streamlining and decentralising authority back into the individual regions, we have a better chance of uniting the nation.
MAL_decentralisation_1코0=Economic Reinvestment
MAL_decentralisation_1_desc코0=Too much of our current economy is underdeveloped, with the vast majority of our income coming from a select few businesses, reinvesting the profits of these businesses into new areas for growth will allow for us to have a much more balanced national economy, and protect against future market shifts.
MAL_decentralisation_2코0=Break the Monopolies
MAL_decentralisation_2_desc코0=The nature of plantation economics means that vast amounts of wealth and production is funneled into the hands of only a select few individuals, dividing these plantations into individually owned, cooperative lots will break these monopolies, at the cost of a reduced net growth.
MAL_decentralisation_3코0=Self-Sufficency
MAL_decentralisation_3_desc코0=As we continue to decentralise our economy, one of the benefits this has created is in a strengthening of local trade and resource management, rather than rely on foreign imports for crucial materials, we can now reliably guarantee basic commodities to our citizens regardless of the international market.
MAL_deslashcentralisation코0=The Unfederated States
MAL_deslashcentralisation_desc코0=The Unfederated States of Malaysia fiercely guard their freedoms from British control, any attempt to unify our nation needs to first decide how to reign in these unruly princes.
MAL_deslashcentralisation_1코0=The Council
MAL_deslashcentralisation_1_desc코0=The Council of Princes represents the closest thing to a native governing body Malaysia has, making friends or enemies of the princes will drastically determine our success in unifying the peninsula.
MAL_deslashcentralisation_2코0=The New Malaysian Economy
MAL_deslashcentralisation_2_desc코0=With our economic future secured, our citizens are beginning to truly believe in the concept of a national Malaysia, united and working together, for the betterment of us all.
MAL_deslashcentralisation_3코0=The Singapore Question
MAL_deslashcentralisation_3_desc코0=Sorry! This doesn't do anything yet.
MAL_the_princes코0=The Princes
MAL_the_princes_desc코0=The Raj's and Sultans of Malaysia still hold large popular support amongst the people, if we can mobilise and unite them, we may have a chance of breaking free from British Tyranny.
MAL_the_princes_1코0=Stack the Council
MAL_the_princes_1_desc코0=The council, for all its faults, represents the will of the princes of Malaysia, our step therefore is to unify the council members alongside our nationalist goals, by coercion if necessary.
MAL_the_princes_2코0=Religion, Language, Royalty
MAL_the_princes_2_desc코0=Malaysia has always been a divided land, but now, thanks to the work of the imperialist British, we have been united together under and against a common enemy, let us celebrate our cultural unity as we strive to overthrow our oppressors.
MAL_the_princes_3코0=Pressure the Settlements
MAL_the_princes_3_desc코0=The Straits Settlements remain the only part of British Malaya outside of royal reach, under the pretext of national rights, we shall petition for the governor to step down and instead appoint a local ruler to join the council, effectively severing British oversight of Malaysia.
MAL_the_princes_4코0=Divine Rule
MAL_the_princes_4_desc코0=With the council's position secured, an elected monarch from within the council should be appointed as head of state, to act as first amongst equals in governing our new nation.
MAL_the_princes_4_a코0=People's Rule
MAL_the_princes_4_a_desc코0=The council has served its purpose, but is merely another tool for oppressing the Malay people, we shall eliminate them and instate a true people's leader to guide our nation.
MAL_the_princes_5코0=Divine Intervention
MAL_the_princes_5_desc코0=If we are to receive a second chance in our bid for freedom, we will need outside support, the Japanese Empire has championed the idea of a western-free East Asia, perhaps they will be able to secure our freedom.
MAL_the_princes_6코0=Bangsa Melayu
MAL_the_princes_6_desc코0=Our nation has emerged free and equal, with a people that are ready to fight and die for its sovreignty, let the Malay Race never again be subject to another!
MAL_the_nation코0=The Nation
MAL_the_nation_desc코0=If we are to gain our freedom, it will be freedom from all tyrants, both within and without, only the democratic will of the people can secure the future of an independent Malaysia.
MAL_the_nation_1코0=Malaya for Malays
MAL_the_nation_1_desc코0=The Malay people are the rightful citizens of Malaysia, it is only through calling upon our ethnic unity that we have any chance of rising the people to freedom.
MAL_the_nation_2코0=Malaya for Malaysians
MAL_the_nation_2_desc코0=Freedom is freedom for everyone, whether Malay, Chinese, or Indian. Every man and woman that calls our country home should have the right to be called Malaysian.
MAL_the_nation_3코0=Student Movements
MAL_the_nation_3_desc코0=The youth of Malaysia, brought up in the knowledge of independence and liberty, are the future of Malaysia, we must ensure they are ready to take up the torch in leading our country to freedom.
MAL_the_nation_4코0=Support Princely Rule
MAL_the_nation_4_desc코0=While we hold fast in our values of democracy, we cannot ignore the popularity the princes of Malaysia still hold, offering some form of guarantee of their positions may give us the support we need to declare our independence.
MAL_the_nation_5코0=Coalition Talks
MAL_the_nation_5_desc코0=The communists are small in number and popularity, but they are quite keen. Perhaps proposing a political coalition might stay any political upheaval further down the road.
MAL_the_nation_6코0=Dismiss the Resident Generals
MAL_the_nation_6_desc코0=The resident generals infest every part of our nation, controlling and manipulating our people from afar, by denouncing the role and refusing to listen to their poisonous 'advice,' we can show british control to be flimsy sham it really is.
MAL_the_nation_7코0=The Federation of Malaya
MAL_the_nation_7_desc코0=We are a shining beacon of freedom in East Asia, alone amongst our people we have created a haven of unity, democracy, and liberty for all, Bersekutu Bertambah Mutu!
MAL_the_air코0=The Air
MAL_the_air_desc코0=Our air force is currently woefully unequipped to provide any support to our main forces, by focusing on our aerial capabilities we can attempt to rectify this and provide adequate cover to both our land and sea operations.
MAL_the_air_1코0=R.A.F. Requisitions
MAL_the_air_1_desc코0=R.A.F. Surplus supplies may not be the best, but they are available, and they are cheap, these requisitions will serve as the cornerstone of our new airforce.
MAL_the_air_2코0=Anti-Air Efforts
MAL_the_air_2_desc코0=Despite our best efforts to modernise our airforce, it is likely that we will lose any battle for our airspace, anti-air fortifications are needed to make sure that if we lose the battle in the air, we can still fight back from the ground.
MAL_the_air_3코0=Fighter Interception Training
MAL_the_air_3_desc코0=Focusing on denying enemy air superiority will not be easy, but with specialised anti-fighter training, we can focus our air crews on dog-fighting combat to maintain control of our skies.
MAL_the_island코0=The Island
MAL_the_island_desc코0=If Singapore falls, the colony falls. Proactively fortifying the whole peninsula is crucial to maintaining any degree of defense.
MAL_the_island_1코0=Military Reorganisation
MAL_the_island_1_desc코0=Our ground forces currently consist of a mishmash of colonial conscripts, british recruits, and local militias, to put up any form of defense against incursion, we need to reorganise these disparate groups into a single cohesive force.
MAL_the_island_2코0=Secure the North
MAL_the_island_2_desc코0=Siam is weak, and very likely to cave to any outside pressure, border fortifications and increased patrols are the first step to securing our defenses.
MAL_the_island_3코0=Fortify the Cities
MAL_the_island_3_desc코0=While it may be impossible to hold a line against foreign advancement, if we can at least secure our major population centres we can forestall a possible collapse of the colony.
MAL_the_island_air_straits코0=Preemptive Measures
MAL_the_island_air_straits_desc코0=War is inevitable, and we need to prepare sooner rather than later, legislating wartime procedures may be unpopular, but will be necessary to protect the colony.
MAL_the_island_air_straits_1코0=War Acts
MAL_the_island_air_straits_1_desc코0=The worst has come to past, there is no more time for planning, appeasement or preparation, now is the time to wait, and hope, and fight.
MAL_the_island_air_straits_2코0=Blow the Causeways
MAL_the_island_air_straits_2_desc코0=As a last ditch effort to slow any enemy advancement the causeways connecting the island of singapore from the mainland must be severed. Not One Step Back.
MAL_the_straits코0=The Straits
MAL_the_straits_desc코0=The sole purpose of British Malaya as a colony is to secure naval power in the straits of Southeast Asia, if we cannot do this, we are worth less than nothing on the world stage.
MAL_the_straits_1코0=Singapore Shipyards
MAL_the_straits_1_desc코0=Our naval construction capacity is low, but there is ample room for improvement. By appropriating the civilian shipping industry in Singapore we can begin to produce our own naval forces.
MAL_the_straits_2코0=Request the Z Division
MAL_the_straits_2_desc코0=While we hold a key choke point in Southeast Asia, British command has refused to transfer control of the Malaysian fleet to our jurisdiction, if we can convince them otherwise, it would go a long way to expanding our naval power in the region.
MAL_the_straits_3코0=Anti-Amphibious Defense Stratagems
MAL_the_straits_3_desc코0=It is very likely that before long, we will be faced with a fully-fledged naval invasion, we need to therefore secure all ports from enemy incursion to cut off any chance of their resupply.

MAL_RND_desc코0=With recent advances in our autonomy, we can begin to have our own fully-fledged research department, to develop technology to be protect and adapt to our environment here in the colonies.

MAL_RND_2코0=Naval Efforts
MAL_RND_2_desc코0=While we already have a sizable naval presence in the region, if we are to maintain it, we will need to develop local naval indsutries to repair and improve upon our current fleet.
MAL_RND_3코0=Jungle Doctrine
MAL_RND_3_desc코0=A large amount of the Malay peninsula is dense jungle, by training our troops in these environments we will possess an edge against any foreign invaders.
MAL_RND_4코0=Infantry Mobilisation
MAL_RND_4_desc코0=The terrain of Malaya can be a hellhole to traverse through for traditional vehicles, by adopting a light, infantry based model, we can better mobilise our troops to reinforce where needed.
MAL_RND_5코0=Fleet Conservation
MAL_RND_5_desc코0=The reality of our naval situation is that we will never be able to outmatch any of our neighbours in a pitched battle, therefore, our main goal should be to conversve our fleet power as much as possible, and only engage where necessary.
MAL_RND_6코0=Defense In Depth
MAL_RND_6_desc코0=It's easier to hold ground than take it. By training our troops in quick-defense and entrenchment tactics, we can maintain a hold on our main territories against even the fiercest enemies.
MAL_RND_7코0=Mechanisation
MAL_RND_7_desc코0=Infantry can only travel so far on foot, incorporating motorized vehicles into our armed forces will mean we can avoid being cut off in the jungle from our allied lines.
MAL_RND_8코0=Straits Navy
MAL_RND_8_desc코0=The most important focus of our navy is in maintaining control of the Straits of Malacca, upgrading our fleet size to better patrol this strait is imperative to our continued naval sovreignty.
MAL_RND_9코0=Marine Training
MAL_RND_9_desc코0=British Malaya is unique in that it's two major regions are separated by a relatively short gap of water, if ever one of our colonies was to fall, our troops need to be able to mount a successful naval invasion to retake it.
MAL_RND_10코0=Theoretical Efforts

MAL_worldstage코0=The World Stage
MAL_worldstage_desc코0=Asi an independent nation, we can now begin to look outwards to our neighbours, and our new relations with them.
MAL_worldstage_1코0=Support the Indonesian Communists
MAL_worldstage_1_desc코0=Indonesia is ripe for revolution, with our shared culture and history we are in a unique position to help them achieve this goal.
MAL_worldstage_2코0=Liberate The Philippines
MAL_worldstage_2_desc코0=The American Empire is merely a different shade of imperialism, we need to help our neighbours in the philippines and save them from themselves.

MAL_japanese_puppet코0=A Loyal Servant
MAL_japanese_puppet_desc코0=Fighting against the new order is pointless, it is better to accept a position of servitude then to resist and be crushed.
MAL_japanese_puppet_1코0=An Imperial Brother?
MAL_japanese_puppet_1_desc코0=We have proven ourselves loyal, and have been granted the boons that come with such loyalty, let us continue to joyfully serve the chrysanthemum throne.

MAL_seek_investors코0=Seek Investors
MAL_seek_investors_desc코0=As a colonial nation, we are in the unique opportunity to court new economic ventures from western powers in the region, to better invest in our own economy.

malaysia.1.t코0=The State of the Colony
malaysia.1.desc코0=Despite a relatively peaceful exterior, the settlements, protectorates, and native alliances that make up British Malaya are fraught with tension. Rather than a functioning state, British Malaya comprises a patchwork of various princes and resident generals, who are de-facto lead by the governor of Singapore. The result is a colony that is ready to collapse at any moment, and requires major restructuring if it is to survive the coming storm.
malaysia.1.a코0=Let's get to work.

malaysia.2.t코0=Malaysia Requests Naval Autonomy
malaysia.2.desc코0=Despite the relative distance between the home office and our Asian territories, the control over our naval presence in the region still lies in London, not Singapore. Citing the inefficiency of such an arrangement and the benefits to naval control in the region, Far East Command has requested that we transfer control of a portion of the Asian navy to British Malayan control.
malaysia.2.a코0=A reasonable request.
malaysia.2.b코0=Out of the question!

malaysia.6.t코0=The Unfederated States
malaysia.6.desc코0=The Unfederated States of Malaysia are a byproduct of the gradual, unplanned colonisation of the malaysian peninsula, while efforts have been made to organise these disparate groups, our attempts so far have been unsuccessful. Thus, it is time for us to make a final decision on the fate of the Unfederated States, and their future in the colony.
malaysia.6.a코0=Fully incorporate them!
malaysia.6.b코0=Focus on joining them with their federated brothers.
malaysia.6.c코0=Leave them be.

malaysia.7.t코0=The Council of Princes
malaysia.7.desc코0='Majlis Raja-Raja,' the Council of Rulers, was one of the earliest concessions granted to the newly federated Malay states, while their practical power is limited, the princes and rajs that make up the council wield tremendous influence in the region, and as such need to be delt with before any further modernisation can begin.
malaysia.7.a코0=Strengthen their powers.
malaysia.7.b코0=Attempt to sideline their influence.
malaysia.7.c코0=Disband the council entirely.

malaysia.9.t코0=The New British Malaya
malaysia.9.desc코0=with the final vestiges of native autonomy removed, British control over Malaysia is paramount. While this may come back to haunt us one day, for now, it allows us an uprecedented amount of control over the colony.
malaysia.9.a코0=God Save the King!

malaysia.10.t코0=The Malayan Emergency
malaysia.10.desc코0=In response to growing fears of Japanese occupation, Malayan communist agitators have managed to storm the governor's house in Singapore, and take control of the colony. While fighting between partisans and police units have broken out throughout the other settlements, the communists have used this momentum to declare independence from us!
malaysia.10.a코0=Good riddance.
malaysia.10.b코0=The only red allowed is on the Union Jack!

malaysia.12.t코0=The New Malaysia
malaysia.12.desc코0=With our economic future secured, our citizens are beginning to truly believe in the concept of a national Malaysia, united and working together, for the betterment of us all.
malaysia.12.a코0=Bersekutu Bertambah Mutu!

malaysia.13.t코0=Malaysia Cuts Ties!
malaysia.13.desc코0=Despite our best efforts to curb Malaysian autonomy, a confederation of princes, businessmen, and influential native activists have managed to bring the colony to a standstill, they have demanded full political and economic autonomy for Malaysia, and managed to seize control of Singapore!
malaysia.13.a코0=Fine, let them deal with an invasion.
malaysia.13.b코0=Are they mad? Send in the navy!

malaysia.15.t코0=Malaysian Nationalist Demands
malaysia.15.desc코0=A coalition of princes in British Malaya have demanded the return of the Straits Settlements to princely rule. While their demands for native representation have a large popular support, it would effectively remove any control we have over mainland Malaysia, and independence would soon follow.
malaysia.15.a코0=Perhaps they can do a better job than us.
malaysia.15.b코0=Since when did we listen to natives?

malaysia.16.t코0=Britain Refuses
malaysia.16.desc코0=The foreign office has outright refused any concessions to native autonomy, while the situation on the ground is terse, the governor stays, for now.
malaysia.16.a코0=We must look elsewhere for freedom.

malaysia.18.t코0=Malaysia Asks For Greater Autonomy
malaysia.18.desc코0=Having proved themselves a loyal subject, our government in Malaysia has asked that we grant them increased autonomy in the region, as a reward for their continued obediance. 
malaysia.18.a코0=Very well.
malaysia.18.b코0=They have not proven themselves yet.

malaysia.19.t코0=Malaysia Petitions for Decolonization!
malaysia.19.desc코0=Having won their hard-fought freedom from the British, Malaysia has now turned its eye to us, demanding that we respect the sovereign rights of the Indonesian people and prepare for decolonisation. While they do not pose much of a threat militarily, the chances of us managing to put down a native revolt with Malaysian support are less certain. How should we respond?
malaysia.19.a코0=Perhaps they're right.
malaysia.19.b코0=Since when did we take orders from Malaysia?

malaysia.20.t코0=Malaysia Petitions for Decolonization!
malaysia.20.desc코0=Having won their hard-fought freedom from the British, Malaysia has now turned its eye to us, demanding that we respect the sovereign rights of the Philippine people and prepare for decolonisation. While they do not pose much of a threat militarily, the chances of us managing to put down a native revolt with Malaysian support are less certain. How should we respond?
malaysia.20.a코0=Perhaps they're right.
malaysia.20.b코0=Since when did we take orders from Malaysia?

malaysia.21.t코0=Malaysia Asks For Support!
malaysia.21.desc코0=A native nationalist movement has taken hold of the colony of British Malaya, while their efforts so far have been thwarted, a delegation of local rulers have sent a secret envoy, pledging subserviance in exchange for supporting their freedom.
malaysia.21.a코0=They shall have it.
malaysia.21.b코0=It's too risky.

malaysia.22.t코0=Japan Presses Malaysian Indpendence
malaysia.22.desc코0=It appears our attempts to quell Malaysian independence have backfired, the Japanese Emperor has personally demanded that Britain recognise Malaysias independence, and has threatened to take action unless we abandon the colony. Doing so would almost assuredly let Malaysia fall into Japanese hands, but refusing might draw us into an unfavourable war, what should we do?
malaysia.22.a코0=We have no choice but to appease them.
malaysia.23.b코0=Perhaps we didn't make ourselves clear: NO.

malaysia.23.t코0=Japan Refuses.
malaysia.23.desc코0=Whether through indifference or incapability, Japan has refused to support our cause for freedom, we are once again, on our own.
malaysia.23.a코0=Our time will come.

malaysia.24.t코0=England Refuses to Back Down!
malaysia.24.desc코0=Despite the tensions in the region and chaos at their doorstep, the British Empire has refused to abandon Malaysia, it appears if we are to make good on our support, we must use force.
malaysia.24.a코0=Finally, a worthy opponent.
malaysia.24.b코0=Let us wait for a more favourable opportunity.

malaysia.25.t코0=Malaysia Revolts!
malaysia.25.desc코0=With finally having reached our shore, the position in our Malaysian colonies, once relatively stable, has collapsed entirely. Aggravated by our previous failure to grant them independence, nationalist forces have ruthlessly expelled all colonial officers from the nation, declaring themselves a fully independent state.
malaysia.25.a코0=Ok
malaysia.25.b코0=Ok

malaysia.26.t코0=Tunsten Extraction Slows Down
malaysia.26.desc코0=Following the prediction of the geologists, the Tunsten is beginning to slow down. Intervention may be necessary but in any case it will only delay the inevitable. At some point there will be no more ore to extract.
malaysia.26.a코0=Ok
