est.1.t코0=Invitation from Estonia
est.1.d코0=Following the tightening tensions in Europe, Estonia is now calling for a defensive alliance between the Soumi-Ugri states. This, however, is not without its opponents. The general consensus within [Root.GetLeader]'s cabinet is that our country can readily defend itself from any and all outside threats. Be it so that the unlikely event of the break of another Great War were to even happen
est.1.a코0=Accept
est.1.b코0=Decline
est.2.t코0=[From.GetName] says YES!
est.2.d코0=After careful deliberation and negotiation, our diplomatic representetive in [From.GetName] has informed us via telegram that our invitation to co-operation has been most graciously accepted.
est.2.a코0=Long-live our Suomi-Ugri alliance!
est.3.t코0=Latvian Cores
est.3.d코0=Since we have conquered all the former territory of Latvia we now have the opportunity to expand even futher our empire in ways never done before instead of constantly chasing the path of our ancestors. We can potentially unite all the former Livonian order lands to a single nation!

est.4.t코0=A tale of Leningrad
est.4.d코0=Following the stunning victory of Estonian forces that the history has never seen before it is now time to destroy the last vestiges of bolshevist rule in Europe. Leningrad the birthplace of communism must be cleared away!

est.5.b코0=Victory Belongs To Us!
est.5.a코0=Another country has fallen to its enemy..
est.6.t코0=Fall of Leningrad
est.6.d코0=Leningrad, the former capital of the Russian Empire, has been occupied by Estonian forces. With a population of over three million, the city has twice as many inhabitants as all of Estonia, but this fact has evidently not deterred the Estonian attackers.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether the city should be integrated into Greater Estonia, since different soumi-ugri speaking people make up a considerable minority in the regions outside the city. This, of course, assumes that the Red Army is unable to retake the city in a counteroffensive.
est.6.a코0=Okay
est.6.b코0=Take that, Bolševiks!
est.7.t코0=Communist Supporters
est.7.d코0=The Soviet Union grows stronger by the day and our country is not strong enough to defend it and the struggles with the communist supporters.

Socialism is and will be a big threat in future if we do not deal with it now.
est.8.t코0=Surplus of Food
est.8.d코0=Since the start of the great depression in 1929 with industry and agriculture declining 20 to 45% respectively we now have finally surpassed the level of before 1930's. Milk, cheese, meat and wheat are produced more than used and our economy is growing faster than ever before.
est.9.t코0=Unhappiness among the Troops
est.9.d코0=Estonian armed forces had successfully taken latvia in the last war. Now when we have declared war on lithuania and fought several battles, casualties are increasing and many of our soldiers are wounded. They are exhausted and don't see the point why to fight against the fellow nabers. \n\nWe must somehow solve this problem and make our army great again!
est.10.t코0=1941 Severe Winter
est.10.d코0=This year, winter has arrived early and it brought the lowest temperature of Europe ever recorded during the last 100 years, measured -43° northeast of Narva. The bitter cold has caused big problems for our army's equipment and guns. Our general Laidoner's 1. infantry force reported moderate frostbite cases at the rate of 200per day.

est.11.d코0=With the signing of a treaty of friendship between our nations, [From.GetName] has requested that [Root.GetName] joins them in their [From.GetFactionName], to unite against the growing threats that surround our nations. Whether communist or fascist, [From.GetName] promises to stand up for [Root.GetAdjective] interests.
est.11.a코0=[Root.GetName] stands with its brothers.

est.12.a코0=[Root.GetName] and [From.GetName] today stands as brothers.
est.13.t코0=[From.GetName] Refuses to Join [Root.GetFactionName]
est.13.d코0=In a foolish act of imagined self-preservation, [From.GetLeader] today announced that [From.GetName] will refrain from any diplomatic action that may be seen as threatening to their powerful neighbors. It has therefore declined our request that they join the [Root.GetFactionName].
est.13.a코0=The only safety is standing together.
est.14.t코0=1936 National Assembly Election
est.14.d코0=A Constitional referendum is crrently being held on the basis that the previous constitution was too authoritarian. All parties have been banned, except for the Patriotic League, leaving the fate of the constitution practically sealed.
est.14.a코0=Estonia needs a strong leader through these times.
est.15.t코0=Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty
est.15.d코0=The Estonian government has offered us military access to their bases if we in turn guarantee them from any invasions or threats. Accepting this could potentially benefit us by placing them further in our sphere.
est.15.a코0=This will benefit us greatly.
est.15.b코0=This is just a waste of our time and resources.
est.16.t코0=Soviets Accept Proposal
est.16.d코0=Soviet troops have now begun to move into bases, with the Soviet authorities stating they have accepted our proposal and will protect us from foreign threats.
est.16.a코0=This is for the best.
est.17.t코0=Soviets Deny Proposal
est.17.d코0=The Soviet regime has ignored any attempts of contact and has refused to negotiate with our diplomats.
est.17.a코0=An unfortunate setback.
est.18.t코0=Unbanned Parties Run in the Election
est.18.d코0=With mass amounts of citizens boycotting the elections Konstantin Päts has been forced to make concessions. Many are calling for the restoration of democracy, while more radical voters wish to seek closer ties with Germany and the Soviet Union. This election can go in any direction.
est.18.a코0=A return to democracy is our best hope.
est.18.b코0=Close ties with Germany is the best course of action.
est.18.c코0=The Estonian Working People's Union will guide us.
