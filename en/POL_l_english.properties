The AVA Radio Company completed the design of such a device, but it never entered into production due to the September Invasion. The Polish Army in Exile in France later reinvisioned the device as a mine detector. The final version was created by Polish Lieutenant Józef Kosacki who donated the blueprint to the British Army. The newly developed man-portable land mine detector was first used in the Battle of El Alamein where 500 detectors helped clear the way for the advance of the British Eighth Army. Over the course of the war, more than 100,000 units would be produced, and the same model would remain in service until the 1991 Gulf War.

poland.110.t코0=The National Defense Fund
poland.110.d코0=In the interwar years Poland was agriculturally self-sufficient, but her state industries and military production were dependent upon considerable foreign imports of raw materials. Thus when the Great Depression struck, countries around the world acted to quickly devalue their currencies; however, the National Bank of Poland kept the value of the Polish złoty strong. A strong currency exacerbated deflation and lowered the amount of foreign reserves available to help the economy, but provided an advantage for purchasing goods from abroad.\n\nTo make the best of the situation, the Polish government created the National Defense Fund. State assets were sold, donations were solicited from citizens living abroad, and fundraisers were setup at home to raise capital, which in turn could purchase raw materials or armaments abroad. Schools, institutions, and parishes were encouraged to donate towards goals such funding the purchase of a machine gun, an artillery piece, or even an airplane. In 1937, the War Office collected 2,330,380 złoty and 6,645 tons of scrap metal. 36 airplanes, 615 heavy machine guns, 130 light machine guns, and various other armaments too numerous to list were acquired. The submarine ORP Orzeł was also commissioned in part thanks to public funds. A presidential decree also went out that all private property was subject to requisition as a contingency in the case of war. This was followed by a second decree in 1938 which tightened state control over agriculture production and made all vehicles and livestock liable for requisition.

poland.121.t코0=Dmowski's Line
poland.121.d코0=Roman Dmowski was the Polish foreign minister for Ignacy Jan Paderewski's government. Unlike Piłsudski who believed that Poland should endeavor to become a multinational federation, Dmowski wanted only territories containing Polish speaking people and had no interest in far eastern lands. The subborness of the nationalist faction would later cause great annoyance and irritation to Piłsudski when Dmowski publicly spoke out against the inclusion of Minsk during the negotiations to end the Polish-Soviet war.\n\nIn the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the Polish delegation submitted its proposal for the theoretical borders of the newly created Polish state. This proposal was called the Dmowski Line. The Dmowski line looked westward and included all of Upper Silesia, parts of Pomeralia, and southern West Prussia. Dmowski admitted that Polish claims to Silesia were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds and on the argument that the Polish minority in the area was highly educated and thus culturally significant. Even with French backing and support, Dmowski would end up disappointed by the Treaty of Versailles which placed the Polish-German border further east than he had hoped for. Out of these negotiations, Dmowski became a bitter enemy of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and accused him of accepting German and Jewish bribes to take an unfavorable stance towards Poland.
poland.121.a코0=We WILL have Upper Silesia.
poland.122.t코0=Poland Demands Upper Silesia

Due to Lithuania's decision to occupy Memel in January 1923, the League of Nations awarded Vilnius to Poland in March 1923. Despite the fact that only 2% of Wilno's population was Lithuanian speaking, the Lithuanian constitution still claims Wilno as its capital. Recently though, a Polish border guard was shot on the border. Protests have errupted in Polish cities demanding war with Lithuania.

poland.130.d코0=Under the threat of war, [From.GetNameDef] is demanding that we renounce our claims on the city of Vilnius, rewrite our constitution to no longer include the city as our capital, and to normalize our relations. How shall we respond?
poland.130.a코0=Better relations with Poland are preferable.

poland.132.t코0=Lithuania Remains Defiant

poland.132.b코0=Drop the issue.
poland.133.t코0=Invite Lithuania to our Faction?
poland.133.d코0=Despite our recent animosity, Poland and Lithuania have long shared historical ties. With the issue of Wilno resolved and relations normalized betweent the two countries, the possibility for military cooperation is now open given the increasingly troublesome storm that is brewing in Europe.
poland.133.a코0=They are liability.
poland.133.b코0=A Polish-Lithuanian Alliance is desirable.
poland.134.t코0=Polish Invitation to join their Faction
poland.134.d코0=On a diplomatic visit, [From.GetLeader] has proposed that Poland and Lithuania can put aside their recent differences and work together to handle the increasingly volatile situation in Europe. [From.GetNameDef] is proposing joint military cooperation to deal with these threats.

poland.140.t코0=[From.GetNameDef] Rejects Ultimatum
poland.140.d코0=[From.GetLeader] has scoffed at our terms and rejected our claims as overly antiquated. It would seem that the issue can only be resolved through force of arms.
poland.140.a코0=Then it is war.
poland.140.b코0=They called our bluff.
poland.141.t코0=The Directorate of Ukraine
poland.141.d코0=In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, two primary Ukrainian states formed: the West Ukrainian People's Republic in Eastern Galicia and the Ukrainian People's Republic in Kiev. Relations between the two nations deterioated as the former saw the Poles as the primary enemy whereas the latter saw Poland as a potential ally against the Soviets and White Russian armies. By July 1919, Poland had conquered much of Galicia and the Western Ukrainian People's Republic ceased to exist. In the east, the Ukrainian People's Republic became the Directorate of Ukraine, a temporary ruling body until a new government could be government could be elected. Symon Petliura, head of the Directorate, withdrew to Poland and signed an alliance in Warsaw which recognized Poland's ownership of Galicia in exchange for military assistance. Józef Piłsudski saw Ukraine as a potential partner in realizing his Intermarium Project of a coalition of various nations joined together in an equal union. With the outbreak of the Polish-Soviet War, an offensive by Poland and Symon Petliura's two remaining divisions captured the city of Kiev before the fortune of war turned, which saw the Soviets reach the gates of Warsaw after which the tide of the war turned again. With the conclusion of the Polish-Soviet war, the Directorate became a government-in-exile based in Tarnów under the close watch of Polish authorities. Many officers of the Directorate's military subsequently were inducted into the Polish army. After Symon Petliura was assassinated by a Bolshevik agent in Paris, leadership of the Directorate passed to Andriy Livytskyi who continued cooperation with Polish authorities.
poland.141.a코0=The glory of Ukraine has not yet perished.
poland.142.t코0=The Recreation of the Ukrainian Army
poland.142.d코0=From volunteers, exiles, and former members of the Ukrainian People's Army we have formed a new army for the Directorate. Though small in size, they will prove useful in consolidating local support in the event war breaks out again with the Soviet Union. As more Ukrainian territory is recaptured by our forces, they will certainly grow considerably in size.
poland.142.a코0=The Intermarium's newest member.
poland.143.t코0=Call-in Japan to War?
poland.143.d코0=Japan is honor-bound to come to our aid in the event the Soviet Union declares war on us. Do we want to call upon their commitments?
poland.143.a코0=We need their aid.
poland.143.b코0=We can do without them.
poland.144.t코0=[From.GetName] Calls us to War
poland.144.d코0=[SOV.GetNameDef] has declared war on [POL.GetNameDef]. Previous treaties demand we come to their aid. Shall we honor them?
poland.144.a코0=We will honor our commitments.
poland.144.b코0=They are a lost cause.

poland.145.d코0=[JAP.GetNameDef] has refused our call to declare war on [SOV.GetName].
poland.145.a코0=It seems we are on our own...
poland.146.t코0=The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
poland.146.d코0=Józef Piłsudski and the Sanacja government held the lofty dream of one day reforming the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite widespread support among various factions, the Lithuanian government proved to be hostile to the idea. A failed Lithuanian military coup was even launched by the Polish government in 1919 as an attempt to instate a friendly regime. But with the area now under Polish control, a new joint administration is already being formed. Across towns in Poland and in some scattered places around Lithuania, celebrations and church bells are resounding in a joyful chorus celebrating the historic moment of reunification.
poland.146.a코0=Together at last.
poland.147.t코0=The Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth
poland.147.d코0=The idea of a Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth consisting of three equal nations originated in the 17th century when the Polish Sejm debated the creation of a Duchy of Ruthenia. Although the measure failed to pass, the idea of a three-way commonwealth emerged once again during the doomed January Uprising in 1863-1864 against the Russian Empire. The underground Polish National Government adopted the colors and insignia of all three nations. In the 20th century, Józef Piłsudski had hoped that the Kiev offensive in the Polish-Soviet war would lead the creation of a union between Poland and Ukraine as part of his Intermarium project. The capture of the city on May 7, 1920 seemed to almost realize his dreams; however, the fortune of the war turned, and thus the project was never fully realized. However, with Kiev now officially under Polish proxy, the Sanacja government can finally bring the late Piłsudski's dream into reality.

poland.149.t코0=Poland Breaks Away
poland.149.d코0=[POL.GetNameDef] has suddenly declared that it will distance itself from [GER.GetNameDef]. It would seem as if they have lost faith in our leadership and have betrayed our common cause. Already Polish partisans and nationalist elements of the Polish Home Army have confronted our garrisons and tensions are running high. How shall we respond?

As a measure to build trust between the two countries, he is proposing that both nations open up their military exports to each other. In spite of our past disagreements, do we want to accept this trade deal?

Privately, they are asking that we transfer to the African Colony of Tanzania into their possession. They claim that colonies are necessary to ensure that the Polish State can remain strong and act as a counterbalance to the growing threats in Europe. They will compensate us in return. Do we want to take up their offer?
poland.154.a코0=We will sell the colony.
poland.154.b코0=Preposterous.
poland.155.t코0=Tanzania Acquired
poland.155.d코0=The British government has agreed to sell us the colony. We have sent an expedition to survey the area and setup a new colonial government. We should make sure we have an international port and a proper merchant marine navy if we want to extract its resources to the fullest extent.

poland.158.t코0=The Nationalists Come to Power
poland.158.d코0=The BBWR coalition was originally created in part to keep National Democracy from obtaining political power. However, its recent decline and constant infighting since Józef Piłsudski's death could no longer prevent Roman Dmowski's party from riding a wave of sudden popular support for change. Decrying the recent April Constitution as undemocratic and a shameful power grab, the new nationalist coalition promises to decentralize the powers of government and usher in a new parliamentary system led by the people.
poland.158.a코0=Make Poland Great Again!
poland.159.t코0=The Forced Polonization of Minorities
poland.159.d코0=The divide between the Sanacja and Endecja movements represented a fundamental split over what constituted the Polish nation. Whereas Józef Piłsudski saw Poland as a diverse coalition of various cultures and ethnicities, Roman Dmowski's nationalists saw Poland as a nation of Poles first and foremost. When Poland was partitioned in the late 18th century, the nationalist movement arose to resist the Germanization of former western Polish lands. With academic and literary groups forming the basis of Polish resistance to outside influence, the nationalist movement in Poland thus came to encompass the more educated and middle classes in Poland.\n\n National Democracy encouraged minority groups to either assimilate or emigrate from the country. Policy platforms included the institution of mandatory education policies for Polish culture and incentives for Poles to settle within non-Polish speaking parts of the country. The influence of the nationalists led to tension and occasional race riots among various ethnic groups in the early interwar period who resented such pressure. Such scattered violence only reinforced Roman Dmowski's views that minority groups posed a threat to Poland's stability. His foreign policy aims stipulated that only territories containing significant Polish speaking populations--many residing in Germany--were worthy of acquisition.
poland.159.a코0=Poland is a nation of Poles.
poland.160.t코0=The Segregation of Minorities
poland.160.d코0=With the National Radical Camp firmly in power, new government policies to mold society are underway. With increasing frequency organized gangs of supporters in uniform have begun making rounds in Polish cities smashing windows and looting minority-owned shops. Unofficially, but secretly planned by the government, non-Polish speaking people are increasingly forced to live in separate and isolated communities. Such actions are part of the government's plan to realize a specific vision of a new homogeneous Greater Poland.

poland.161.t코0=The Castle - Ignacy Mościcki
poland.161.d코0=Born on December 1st, 1867 in Mierzanowo, Ignacy Mościcki was the son of a Polish landowner who had participated in the January Uprising of 1863. After studying chemistry at the Riga Technical University, he became affiliated with left-wing independence groups. He was forced to flee to London and subsequently travelled to Switzerland where he developed a patent for nitric acid production. Shortly after, he made acquaintance with Józef Piłsudski in the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). While staying in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Ignacy Mościcki became a specialist in electro-chemistry. After Piłsudski's May Coup d'État in 1926, Mościcki was elected to office of the Presidency starting on the 4th of June 1926.\n\nFollowing Piłsudski's death and the adoption of the April Constitution, controversy erupted over whether the current president had to stand for re-election under the new articles. Many predicted that if snap elections were held, Prime Minister Walery Sławek would be favored to win. President Mościcki assembled a team of lawyers and legal scholars to make a case that snap elections were unnecessary. Furthermore, he argued that the late Marshal Józef Piłsudski had given his personal blessing for Mościcki to continue the presidency. Thus the Castle political faction took its name from the Royal Castle in Warsaw which housed the embattled President.

Originally a chemist notable for his work in the nitrogen industry, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski served as the Minister of Industry and Trade from 1926 to 1930 and as the Minister of the Treasury from 1935 to 1939. Groomed by Mościcki to be a potential political successor, Kwiatkowski was the mastermind of the successful 4-year plan and the creation of the maritime seaport of Gdynia which began to reverse Poland's economic decline during the Great Depression.

poland.167.t코0=Polish Positivism & Organic Work
poland.167.d코0=After observing the disastrous result of the doomed November 1830 and January 1863 uprisings, the nationalist faction in Poland believed that attempts at violence only hindered the cause of Polish independence. The destruction of Polish property and loss of Polish lives only further eroded a culture under assault by imperial overlords. Instead, in an era of blooming Romanticism the nationalists adopted the view of organic work. Striving for work ethic, artistic contributions, and scientific discoveries were seen as the best methods of preserving Polish culture and territorial integrity. By encouraging individuals to seek out success in life, Polish culture would thus prove to be resilient at attempts to convert it.\n\nThis philosophy continued to be championed by the more moderate Polish nationalist parties in the 20th century. When Józef Piłsudski sought to organize a rebellion during the Russo-Japanese war, Roman Dmowski travelled to Japan and thwarted such plans believing it would be a waste of lives. In the Second Republic, Narodowa Demokracja sought to continue the traditions of organic work in advocating for market capitalism, investments in education, and cultural preservation.

Membership rapidly climbed into the thousands over the course of the siege, and their role expanded to include assisting in communications and intelligence gathering.

Despite initial interest, such plans were rejected by the Japanese government on the insistence of Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's arch-rival, who thought such a rebellion would fail and waste Polish lives. With the creation of the newly formed Polish state after the Great War, Japan offered diplomatic cooperation and helped ethnic Poles escape from Russia and Siberia. In 1923, just after the Polish-Soviet war, a military mission was sent to Japan headed by Polish engineer, cryptologist, and military intelligence officer Jan Kowalewski. During his stay, Jan Kowalewski taught Japanese officers in Tokyo courses on radio intelligence and cryptanalysis. For his efforts, the Japanese government awarded Jan Kowalewski the 'Order of the Rising Sun'.

poland.197.t코0=Strict Regulations for Military Equipment
poland.197.d코0=As part of his effort to ensure the modernization of Poland's military, Marshal Rydz-Śmigły instituted strict requirements for the manufacture of ammunition. The tolerance for defects was greatly reduced but with significant trade-offs in increased production cost and time. Such high standards were intended to attract foreign buyers in order to acquire additional funds to further modernize Poland's military; however, such quality control was well above the standards of other European armies and even drew criticism from foreign advisors.\n\nSuch difference in opinion was demonstrated in one recorded meeting between Polish and French officials. Upon trying to impress French military leaders with examples of high-quality Polish weapons for potential purchase and export, the French delegation declined to buy. When pressed for further reasons why, one French officer replied 'France is simply too poor afford such weapons.' The Polish delegation left the meeting with a smug sense of superiority in their military's equipment standards while the pragmatically minded French shook their heads in disbelief.

Despite the backing of key party figures such as Tomasz Arciszewski and Zygmunt Zaremba, disagreements over leadership of the movement have resulted in a fracturing of the party with chairman Zygmunt Zulawski denouncing the PPS-WRN as illegitimate.

poland.53.t코0=Large Nationalist Rally
poland.53.d코0=The right-wing National Democracy party's power base was in western Poland. Its main ideologue was Roman Dmowski who had the backing of many ethnically Polish intelligentsia, the urban lower middle class, some elements of the greater middle class, and its extensive youth movement. In the mid 1930s, a rift grew between the new and old generations of the party which fragmented the nationalist movement into many small successor parties. One of the most extreme nationalist splinter groups was the National Radical Camp (ONR). The ONR-Falanga is a fringe political party popular among small academic circles on Polish university campuses. They have always been considered an extremist nuisance by the Sanacja government, and their meetings have been broken up by Polish police several times. Today, however, they held an extremely large public rally in defiance of the Sanacja government. How shall we deal with them?
poland.53.a코0=They are too popular. Monitor the situation.
poland.53.b코0=Send in the army to break up the rally.
poland.54.t코0=Large General Strike
poland.54.d코0=Until the end of the Great War, Poland had been partitioned between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia. Upon Poland's independence, the rural eastern regions once part of the Russian Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire still retained a large agricultural sector. The great depression hit the region especially hard. With unemployment reaching above 40% in some areas and the prospect of hunger looming, frustration often fed radicalism. Today another strike was organized by the Agrarian People's Party with some backing by the Polish Socialist Party. Already it has spread to multiple cities. Without intervention the situation could get out of hand.
poland.54.a코0=Ignore them.
poland.54.b코0=Send in the army to arrest the rioters.

poland.55.b코0=We shall remain independent.
poland.56.t코0=Danzig Betrays Us
poland.56.d코0=The Polish garrison in Gdansk has reported that they are under attack by paramilitary forces, police, and militia backed by the local Nazi party in the city. It seems that they have decided to join Germany.
poland.56.a코0=Blasted Traitors.
poland.57.t코0=Danzig Joins [Root.GetName]
poland.57.d코0=Our spies in Danzig have informed us that the local government will back our cause.
poland.57.a코0=Most Excellent.
poland.58.t코0=The Polish Corridor Now Belongs to Germany
poland.58.d코0=Germany has occupied the Polish corridor. Its time to decide if we want to seek reunification.
poland.58.a코0=Reunification with Germany is preferable.
poland.58.b코0=We shall remain independent.
poland.59.t코0=The Front Morges
poland.59.d코0=While well-loved as the father and protector of Poland's independence, Józef Piłsudski's May 1926 Coup d'État against the Second Republic was not met with approval everywhere. Many opposed the turn away from democracy, and those who did often found themselves marginalized or forced into political exile. Among these detractors, the Front Morges was a political alliance of centrist political parties of interwar Poland. It was founded in 1936 in the Swiss village of Morges by general Władysław Sikorski along with former Polish Prime Minister and famous composer Ignacy Paderewski. Prominent activists included general Józef Haller and former Deputy Prime Minister Wojciech Korfanty. Their primary aim was to reinstate democracy, align diplomatically with France, and elect Wicenty Witos as Prime Minister and Paderewski as president.
poland.59.a코0=We welcome their return to politics.
poland.60.t코0=A Union For Falangists?
poland.60.d코0=On a long visit, [From.GetLeader] after touring the country has asked us to join an international front to promote Catholic and Falangist ideals and interests. Despite cultural differences, [From.GetLeader] believes the Falangists of different nations should unite to help usher in a new world order.
poland.60.a코0=United under God we stand.
poland.60.b코0=We only look out for our own national interests.
poland.61.t코0=[From.GetName] Agrees
poland.61.d코0=After much deliberation, [From.GetLeader] has agreed that [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName] share common interests and should stand together on the world stage. Diplomatic envoys are en route to Warsaw to discuss and sign further agreements.
poland.61.a코0=A blessed outcome.
poland.62.t코0=[From.GetName] Declines
poland.62.d코0=Despite many attempts, [From.GetLeader] stated that he did not want to drag [From.GetName] into foreign entanglements. Although intrigued at the idea, [From.GetLeader] also insisted that he must look after the interests of [From.GetName] first and foremost.
poland.62.a코0=How very disapointing.
poland.63.t코0=Diplomatic Mission to France
poland.63.d코0=In light of our new policy diplomatic realignment towards supporting France instead of neutrality, a new diplomatic mission is being sent. We can use this opportunity to discuss a number of issues between our nations.
poland.63.a코0=Ask to Purchase Light Tanks.
poland.63.b코0=Offer to purchase Madagascar.
poland.63.c코0=Just buy up local French investments instead.
poland.64.t코0=Polish Offer to Purchase Tanks
poland.64.d코0=A Polish diplomatic and military delegation has recently arrived. They are requesting permission to work with a private contractor to produce French tanks for their purchase. The payment they are offering is quite substantial.
poland.64.a코0=An intriguing offer.
poland.64.b코0=No deal.
poland.65.t코0=Polish Offer to Purchase Madagascar
poland.65.d코0=A delegation from the Polish Colonial Maritime League has recently arrived. They are making an offer to purchase our colony of Madagascar. The payment they are offering is quite substantial.
poland.65.a코0=An intriguing offer.
poland.65.b코0=No deal.
poland.66.t코0=French Contract Established
poland.66.d코0=France's government has agreed to allow us to setup a contract with a private sector company to produce a batch of tanks for our army.
poland.66.a코0=Excellent.
poland.67.t코0=Madagascar Acquired
poland.67.d코0=France has agreed to sell us the colony of Madagascar. Already an expedition by Polish Army Major Mieczyslaw Lepecki has been sent to survey the area. We should make sure we have an international port and a proper merchant marine navy if we want to extract its resources to the fullest extent.
poland.67.a코0=Poland can into colonies!
poland.68.t코0=Proposal to France Declined
poland.68.d코0=The French government has declined our offer whether it be for fear of our intentions, our allies, or simple mistrust.
poland.68.a코0=We will just buy up French investments instead.
poland.70.t코0=The Sanation Right
poland.70.d코0=In the power vacuum left by Józef Piłsudski's death and the recent April Constitution reforms, the Sanation Right headed by Edward Rydz-Śmigły has managed to maneuver into a position of power by taking advantage of the feuds in the ruling elite.\n\nEdward Rydz-Śmigły is known throughout Poland as a masterful commander in the Polish-Soviet War, having conducted many successful offensives against the Bolsheviks, including the initial capture of Wilno, Dünaburg, and, as Commander-in-Chief of the Latvian armed forces, the province of Latgale. In those most dire moments as Poland's capital found itself besieged by the Red Army, the Central Front under Rydz-Śmigły's leadership held firm in the battle of Warsaw and played in instrumental role in blocking the escape of the Red Army from encirclement.\n\nAfter the Polish-Soviet war's conclusion, Rydz-Śmigły became the Inspector General of the Polish Army in the Wilno district and later the Warsaw district. When Piłsudski launched his 1926 coup d'état, Rydz-Śmigły offered his full support. As a reward for his loyalty, Piłsudski appointed Rydz-Śmigły to Marshal Deputy of all matters concerning the East. In accordance with Piłsudski's final wishes after his passing, Rydz-Śmigły was appointed as Inspector-General of the Polish Armed Forces, the highest Polish military office.
poland.70.a코0=Now onto the present.
poland.71.t코0=Consolidation of the Government
poland.71.d코0=With Walery Sławek marginalised as a serious political player, Ignacy Mościcki outmaneuvered, and with many supporters of the Camp of National Unity in positions of power, the question remains on how to deal with the rest of the ruling elite.
poland.71.a코0=Conclude a power-sharing agreement with President Ignacy Mościcki.
poland.71.b코0=Dissolve the Sejm and take full power.
poland.72.t코0=Power Sharing Agreement
poland.72.d코0=Ignacy Mościcki is a useful ally especially in managing the economic affairs of the country, and he provides a means of retaining many talented connections. In a grand ceremony held today, President Mościcki presented Edward Rydz-Śmigły with the Marshal's baton, elevating him to the special rank only once held by Józef Piłsudski. Edward Rydz-Śmigły is now the Second Marshal of Poland. Much of the elite is bitter about the decision to recreate such a title, but grudgingly they fall in line. Although the state press declares that Marshal Rydz-Śmigły is the 'Second Man in the State after the President' as a mouthpiece of propaganda to placate the public, the truth is that the President holds little power with the Marshal now at the reigns.
poland.72.a코0=The new first soldier of the 'Republic.'
poland.73.t코0=Dissolution of the Sejm
poland.73.d코0=In an emergency session addressing the Sejm, Edward Rydz-Śmigły announced before a jeering audience that the dissolution of the legistlative body would be imminent effectively ending the Second Republic. Edward Rydz-Śmigły proclaimed himself the Second Marshal of Poland and that he—like Józef Piłsudski—will safeguard the nation against all threats. Unlike Piłsudski though, Rydz-Śmigły claims that he will go all the way to ensure that the corruption of government cannot manifest itself under the guise of democratic bodies. The military, already heavily involved in government affairs, will now run the nation entirely. Although the general public is also shocked at the sudden turn of events, the state press is already drawing patriotic comparison's between Marshal Rydz-Śmigły's recent coup d'état against a corrupt elite and Józef Piłsudski's May Coup against a perceived corrupt system.
poland.73.a코0=The leader of the new Polish State.
poland.74.t코0=Diplomatic Report
poland.74.d코0=Relations between the Polish government and the Free City of Danzig have long been tenuous. During the Polish-Soviet war in early 1920s and the German embargo against Poland in 1925, dockyard workers in Gdansk twice refused to unload supplies off of Polish ships. Such concerns over the economic security of Poland led to the impetus behind the creation of the nearby seaport of Gdynia. In 1933, the local branch of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NDSAP) was elected into power. Tensions flared again over Danzig's seperation from Germany and over the city's oppressive treatment of the Polish minority within its borders.\n\nIn a recent diplomatic meeting between Józef Beck, Polish 'Minister of Foreign Affairs', and Joachim von Ribbentrop, German 'Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs', a mutual concensus was finally reached. Adolf Hitler has instructed the local Nazi government to cease anti-Polish actions. In return we have promised to not support the actions of the anti-Nazi opposition in Danzig. Though the issue of the cty's status remains far from settled, our recent rapprochement has yielded some positive results.
poland.74.a코0=Its best to keep aloof from internal Danzig problems.
poland.75.t코0=Foreign Relations Report
poland.75.d코0=Shortly after Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Józef Piłsudski entered Poland into a non-agression pact with Germany on January 26, 1934. Germany agreed to recongize Poland's current borders and halt the damaging customs war that had lasted almost a decade. Józef Piłsudski correctly deduced that the French military would assume a purely defensive posture in the event of war and leave their eastern allies to their own fate. The French construction of the Maginot line starting in 1929 and subsequent French refusal to pressure Germany only reinforced his views.\n\nJózef Piłsudski, however, incorrectly believed that such a pact would eliminate the danger that Poland would be the first target of German aggression. German diplomatic efforts at the time often seemed to suggest favorability to Poland especially as a hegemonic partner against the Soviet Union. Józef Piłsudski still distrusted Hitler but thought that his Austrian ancestry would help mitigate Germany's past icy relations with Poland—contrary to what had been the previous 'Anti-Polish Prussian-sort' of politicians. An opening of trade relations followed, but such friendly offerings were secretly and purposely intended as a ruse to lure the Poles into a false sense of security.
poland.75.a코0=But surely we can avoid war in this timeline, right?
poland.76.t코0=The Changing Political Climate
poland.76.d코0=In 1938, the open diplomatic situation between Germany and Poland changed dramatically. On October 1938, German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop demanded that the Free City of Danzig be returned to Germany with the construction of a highway and railroad link through the Polish corridor to Prussia. In turn, Germany would agree to respect Poland's current borders. While the proposal for a highway link had been floated in the past between Ribbentrop and Beck, such plans were rejected by the Polish government who feared that acceptance would lead to more demands from Germany and the erosion of Poland's independence as a nation. Soon after, Adolf Hitler pressed more demands against the Polish state demanding that they accept 'German consultation on foreign policy'. The Polish government's fears became a reality.
poland.76.a코0=We have chosen to give in, but only in exchange for their protection.
poland.77.t코0=Poland Seeks to Join the Axis
poland.77.d코0=Polish Foreign Minister of Affairs, Józef Beck, has informed us that the Polish government is willing to transfer the Free City of Danzig to us and accept our consultation of their foreign policy. In exchange for these concessions, the Polish government is asking for us to guarantee Poland's existing borders and sign a pact offering protection against the Soviet threat and against any other potential aggressors. How shall we respond?
poland.77.a코0=Excellent.
poland.77.b코0=Our demands are not negotiable.
poland.78.t코0=The Ribbentrop-Beck Pact
poland.78.d코0=The German government has accepted the deal. A new chapter in our history is beginning as we tie our fate to Germany. Though still independent, we have agreed to follow and cooperate with German foreign policy.
poland.78.a코0=Hopefully we can still maintain our independence.
poland.79.t코0=Germany Declines
poland.79.d코0=The German government has declined our offer stating that their demands are not negotiable, and that they are unwilling to sign a pact that binds them to come to our aid in times of war. It can only be concluded that we are an immediate target for their aggression.
poland.79.a코0=This is justifiable cause for the mobilization of our military.
poland.80.t코0=Polish-French Relations
poland.80.d코0=During the Polish-Soviet war, France sent a military mission of 400 officers to Poland. The efforts of the French delegation yielded strong positive results for the organization and logistics of the fledgling Polish army. Shortly after the war's conclusion, a military pact was signed to contain the dual threats of Germany and the Soviet Union. France was obliged to help Poland economically, but was not required declare war if Poland found itself under attack. But with the threat of German rearmanent and aggression looming, the Kasprzycki-Gamelin Convention was signed on May 19, 1939 in Paris. The treaty was named after 'Polish Minister of War Affairs' General Tadeusz Kasprzycki and 'Commander of the French Army' Maurice Gamelin. Both countries were now fully bound together in the event of conflict.\n\nToday we have asked the French to go one step further and preemptively strike at Germany. [Root.GetLeader] has flown to France seeking to build concensus on the German threat and win support for early retaliatory action.
poland.80.a코0=Maybe they will show some backbone this time.
poland.81.t코0=Polish-French Relations
poland.81.d코0=During the Polish-Soviet war, France sent a military mission of 400 officers to Poland. The military mission yielded strong positive results for the organization and logistics of newly formed Polish army. Shortly after the war's conclusion, a military pact was signed to contain the dual threats of Germany and the Soviet Union. France was obliged to help Poland economically, but was not required declare war if Poland found itself under attack. But with the threat of German rearmanent and aggression looming, the Kasprzycki-Gamelin Convention was signed on May 19, 1939 in Paris. The treaty was named after 'Polish Minister of War Affairs' General Tadeusz Kasprzycki and 'Commander of the French Army' Maurice Gamelin. Both countries were now fully bound together in the event of conflict.\n\nToday we will honor those commitments.
poland.81.a코0=There will be no 'Eastern Betrayal'.
poland.82.t코0=Preemptive Strike Against Germany?
poland.82.d코0=The Polish government has come to us with a proposition to strike offensively into the heart of Germany. They are worried about Germany's increasing aggression and rearmament in Europe and would like our assistance in cutting them down to size.
poland.82.a코0=An interesting proposition.
poland.82.b코0=Preposterous.
poland.83.t코0=France Agrees to Retaliate
poland.83.d코0=The French government has agreed with our views and is beginning to mobilize their army in preparation.
poland.83.a코0=Excellent.
poland.84.t코0=The French Back Down
poland.84.d코0=The French government has expressed no interest in the proposal and still believes that Germany can be dealt with diplomatically.
poland.84.a코0=We will attack Germany on our own.
poland.84.b코0=We will keep our army mobilized and prepared instead.
poland.85.t코0=The Second Don Cossack Revolt
poland.85.d코0=Test Event - Incomplete.
poland.85.a코0=Proceed Anyways.
poland.86.t코0=Cult of the Marshal
poland.86.d코0=Piłsudski himself was never interested in elevating himself or creating a mythos surrounding his legacy. One famous quote attributed to the late Marshal is\n\n'I am not going to dictate to you what you write about my life and work. I only ask that you not make me out to be a 'whiner and sentimentalist.'\n\nThe Sanacja government though saw the Marshal's legacy as a useful propaganda tool. Immediately after his death, state media praised him as a brilliant strategist, statesman, visionary, and the father of Poland's independence. School children sang songs and wrote poems commemorating the late Marshal, public rallies and celebrations were organized, statues and great artworks were erected in public places, and 'Polish Independence Day' was declared a national holiday in his honor. Public initiatives to rename streets, towns, and military regiments after his name were widespread. In 1938, the Polish parliament even went so far as to make defaming Piłsudski's name illegal. The cult surrounding Piłsudski was especially popular within the military, and the tradition continued even among the Army in Exile in the West despite Władysław Sikorski's and other detractor's objections. March 19, the day after Piłsudski's birthday, was named Marshal Day where high level military promotions were awarded publically.
poland.86.a코0=The great man who emerged from the First World War.
poland.87.t코0=Rydz-Śmigły's State Propaganda Apparatus
poland.87.d코0=Initially, Rydz-Śmigły tried to portray himself as a man above politics and above political associations; however, overtime Rydz-Śmigły gave increasingly political and passionate public speeches. State propaganda tried to portry him as Piłsudski's heir, and his prominence eclipsed that of the president. Posters, public buildings, and bulletin boards portrayed his athletic pose, tall height, and confident but gentle smile. As the prospect of war loomed, his popularity reached its zenith. State propaganda, which included adulatory songs, poetry, and almost daily revelations about his life in the press, were a means to distract the masses from the dire economic situation that beset the country and the foreign policy failings of the new regime. Poland's swift defeat in 1939 came as a thunderous shock to the public who believed that between Rydz-Śmigły's guiding hand and the help of the Western Allies, Germany would be quickly defeated.

poland.88.a코0='God, Honor, Fatherland'\n  - Polish Army Motto
poland.89.t코0=Rydz-Śmigły's Air Force Reforms
poland.89.d코0=Despite the strong aviation industry that developed in Poland and the air superiority Poland enjoyed in the Polish-Soviet war, Józef Piłsudski saw the air force as a mere fancy and expensive sideshow. Piłsudski envisioned the army and the cavalry as the dominant force on the future battlefield and neglected to invest heavily in the aviation branch. Edward Rydz-Śmigły saw otherwise and believed the air force would play an important role in the upcoming conflict. A large investment program in the air force and the army aviation branch soon followed. Funding for aircraft development, training, and support was increased; and with these developments, Polish doctrine was revised to envision air support as a rapid response unit for critical emergency situations rather than a scattered tactical asset.
poland.89.a코0='Pro Patria Semper'\n  - Polish Air Force Motto
poland.90.t코0=Polish Military Aviation Exports
poland.90.d코0=In 1933, the all metal fighter design, Zygmunt Pulawsk's PZL P.7a, was introduced. This was soon followed by the more developed PZL P.11a and PZL P.11c which were among the most advanced fighters in the world at the time of their introduction in 1934 and 1935 respectively. With the advent of the Great Depression, budget shortcomings meant that aircraft designs had to be available for export to fund the military. Additional aircraft models such as the P.11b, P.24A, P.24B, P.24G, and PZL.43 Karaś light bomber were superior in specification but produced exclusively for export and not for Poland's own military. Hundreds of aircraft were instead sold abroad to various countries. Buyers of interwar Polish fighter aircraft and light reconnaissance bombers included Greece, Portugal, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Republican Spain, Hungary, and Romania. Even after Poland's capitulation in 1939, Polish aircraft were still operated, produced, and developed upon abroad. When operation Barbarossa began, just under half of Romania's airforce consisted of Polish planes, and the domestic IAR 80 fighter was a development of the Polish P.24E.
poland.90.a코0=Whatever Keeps Our Budget in the Black.
poland.91.t코0=The April Constitution
poland.91.d코0=The April Constitution's main ideologue was Walery Slawek, and its drafting would lead to controversy between the Sanation Left and the Castle faction over who would hold the position of the presidency. In its articles, the idea was introduced that the state was the common good of the citizens, and the powers of the President were greatly expanded at the expense of the Senate and Sejm. Under the new articles, the President had the power to appoint 1/3rd of senators, the Commander-in-chief of the Polish Army, the Inspector General of the Armed Forces, and held the right to dismiss parliament and veto laws that were passed 'non-constructively'.\n\nThe president also had the authority to declare a successor in the event of an emergency or war. This became the basis for the Polish Government in Exile in the West. When Ignacy Mościcki was interned in Romanian Exile as the battle for Poland still raged on, Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski, Polish general and ambassador in Rome, was named the new President of Poland. One day later, Wieniawa-Dlugoszowski would abdicate under pressure from Władysław Sikorski and pass the mantle of the Presidency to him. But elsewhere in 1944, the Soviet-backed authorities in communist Poland rejected the constitution as invalid and operated under the 1921 March Constitution.
poland.91.a코0=A Presidential System or Authoritarianism?
poland.92.t코0=Polish Ultimatum
poland.92.d코0=The Polish Government has taken notice of the rising popularity of far left-wing ideology within our borders. Fearing for their own security, they are demanding that we implement a ban on communism within our country and for us to accept their consultation on our foreign policy. How shall we respond?
poland.92.a코0=Unreasonable Demands
poland.92.b코0=We have to give in.
poland.93.t코0=Romania Declines our Ultimatum
poland.93.d코0=Romania has refused our demands. There is a dangerous possibility that they may continue to slip into the Soviet Union's orbit. It would seem as if the issue can only be further solved through force of arms.
poland.93.a코0=They called our bluff.
poland.93.b코0=We must intervene now.
poland.94.t코0=Romania Agrees to our Demands
poland.94.d코0=Romania has agreed to our demands. Legislation is being drafted to ban communism, and their government has agreed to defer to our foreign policy.
poland.94.a코0=Excellent.
poland.95.t코0=2nd Military Mission to Japan
poland.95.d코0=With a shared common enemy, Poland and Japan have long kept friendly foreign relations. In 1904 while the Russo-Japanese war raged on, Józef Piłsudski travelled to Tokyo to offer his assistance in organizing a Polish rebellion against Russia. Despite initial interest, such plans were rejected by the Japanese government on the insistence of Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's arch-rival, who thought such a rebellion would fail and waste Polish lives. With the creation of the newly formed Polish state after the Great War, Japan offered diplomatic cooperation and helped ethnic Poles escape from Russia and Siberia. In 1923, just after the Polish-Soviet war, a military mission was sent to Japan headed by Polish engineer, cryptologist, and military intelligence officer Jan Kowalewski. During his stay, Jan Kowalewski taught Japanese officers in Tokyo courses on radio intelligence and cryptanalysis. For his efforts, the Japanese government awarded Jan Kowalewski the 'Order of the Rising Sun'.\n\nNow we are planning to send Lieutenant Colonel Jan Kowalewski on a second military mission to Japan to offer more advanced technical assistance on code-breaking and cryptanalysis efforts. What do we want in return for our technical expertise?
poland.95.a코0=Offer to join their war against the Soviet Union.
poland.95.b코0=Ask to join their faction.
poland.95.c코0=Ask for a guarantee against Soviet aggression.
poland.95.e코0=Offer our technical assistance only.
poland.96.t코0=Poland Comes to our Aid
poland.96.d코0=[From.GetName] has informed us that they will attack the Soviet Union in concert with us. Lieutenant Colonel Jan Kowalewski, who was sent in 1923 to provide intelligence training for our army, is being sent again to Tokyo to instruct our officers on code-breaking and cryptanalysis efforts.
poland.96.a코0=All help is welcome.
poland.97.t코0=Poland Requests to Join our Faction.
poland.97.d코0=A diplomatic envoy from [From.GetName] has asked that we allow them to join our faction. In exchange for our close cooperation, they are offering to send Lieutenant Colonel Jan Kowalewski, who in 1923 provided intelligence training for our army, again to Tokyo to instruct our officers on code-breaking and cryptanalysis efforts.
poland.97.a코0=Poland and Japan will stand together.
poland.97.b코0=We would rather not entangle ourselves with them.
poland.98.t코0=Poland Offers Technical Assistance in Exchange for a Guarantee
poland.98.d코0=A diplomatic envoy from [From.GetName] has asked that we assist Poland in the event that war breaks our between them and the Soviet Union. In exchange for our guarantee, they are offering to send Lieutenant Colonel Jan Kowalewski, who in 1923 provided intelligence training for our army, again to Tokyo to instruct our officers on code-breaking and cryptanalysis efforts.
poland.98.a코0=An interesting proposition.
poland.98.b코0=We cannot afford to be drawn into a war.
poland.100.t코0=Poland and Japan Announce an Alliance
poland.100.d코0=With a shared common enemy in the Soviet Union, Poland and Japan have announced that they have entered into a military alliance with each other.
poland.100.a코0=An interesting development.
poland.101.t코0=Japan Declines our Offer
poland.101.d코0=[From.GetNameDef] has declined. It would seem as if they do not want to entangle themselves in commitments with us despite our offerings.
poland.101.a코0=How disappointing.
poland.102.t코0=Japan Accepts our Offer
poland.102.d코0=[From.GetNameDef] has accepted our offer. Formal arrangements and the signing of the treaty are already underway.

poland.103.a코0=Authorize the mission.
poland.103.b코0=Order them to stand down for now.
poland.104.t코0=Polish-Czechoslovakian Relations
poland.104.d코0=For much of the early interwar period, relations between Poland and Czechoslovakia were fraught with constant border conflicts and tensions. Zaolzie with its valuable coal mines and railroad links was disputed between the two nations. A brief border war was fought in which Czechoslovakia managed to take control of most of the region; however, intervention by the Western Allies forced a withdrawal. Under Western supervision, ethnic plebicites were to be held, and the region would be divided. Both nations agreed to accept Allied deliberations; however, with the advent of the Polish-Soviet War and the Soviet advance on Warsaw, fears were raised among the Allies that a Polish defeat would result in the region falling into Bolshevik hands. The Spa Conference in July 1920 awarded lands to Czechoslovakia that included large Polish populations but left few Czechs under Polish rule. The conference decision left bitter feelings among the local Polish population who felt discriminated against by the Czech government.
poland.104.a코0=We will deliver our demands.
poland.105.t코0=Polish Demands
poland.105.d코0=Polish foreign minister Józef Beck has delivered a list of demands. They are demanding we cede Zaolzie and allow the partitioning of Slovakia between Poland and Hungary. If we do not comply, the sitution will lead to war. How shall we respond?
poland.105.a코0=We have no choice but to give in.
poland.105.b코0=Death before Dishonor.
poland.106.t코0=Czechoslovakia Yields
poland.106.d코0=Czechoslovakia has agreed to our demands. Our forces have entered the disputed area. On the border regions, cheering crowds of Polish minorities have greeted our soldiers. Celebrations are also taking place across Polish cities to commemorate unification.
