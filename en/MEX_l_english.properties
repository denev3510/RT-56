MEX_Perfect_Dictatorship_desc코0=Historically, the Camarilla won as Miguel Aleman became president after Camacho's death. It is said that the 70 years from this point, where the PRI had unrivalled political power, was the perfect dictatorship.
MEX_Perfect_Dictatorship2코0=The Shadow of Death
MEX_Perfect_Dictatorship2_desc코0=The Shadow of Death
MEX_Marias코0=Renovate Islas Marias

MEX_Colegio코0=El Colegio de México
MEX_Colegio_desc코0=El Colegio de México
MEX_Syndicalist코0=A Union of Unions
MEX_Syndicalist_desc코0=Mexico's form of communism was always rather unique. Opposed to Soviet communism, popular Mexican communism came in a variant to Syndicalism. Unions were given great importance and place in the government, meant to reflect the will of the people, with some wishful thinking revolving around the idea of taking back the mines from foreigners to hand back to Mexicans.

MEX_Contain_ENG코0=Contain British Influence
MEX_Contain_ENG_desc코0=Mexican interests are threatened as long as the United Kingdom is in the Caribbean. By forcing the British out of the region, we can set up our own sphere of influence.
MEX_ENG_Grab코0=Grab her by the Colonies!
MEX_ENG_Grab_desc코0=The United Kingdom must not be allowed to have such unrivaled power if we are to project ourselves onto the world stage. Taking its colonies would severely dismantle the empire.
MEX_ZOOT코0=Intervene in the United States
MEX_ZOOT_desc코0=Following the Zoot Suit riots and the attack on Mexicans by US citizens and service members, there was wide outcry to intervene by the far left and far right.

###EVENTS

mexico_calles.1.t코0=REBELS ATTACK TRAIN!
mexico_calles.1.d코0=A Mexico City-Veracruz train was ambushed yesterday by dissidents, killing multiple PRM Mexican politicians. The train was ambushed at a bridge, that was rigged with explosives, ruling out a bandit robbery as the motive for the attack. The train was found by officials completely destroyed by fire, leaving little behind for investigators. It is not known if the explosion set fire to the cars, or they were set on fire by the attackers to destroy evidence. Mexico has been facing increasing political polarization, and now it seems political extremists are now resorting to violence.
mexico_calles.1.a코0=Tragic.
mexico_calles.1.b코0=Calles will pay for this, in time.

mexico_calles.2.t코0=Operation: Mi Lucha
mexico_calles.2.d코0=We finally have a reason to arrest Calles. Public support for his arrest is high, if we can surround his rancho with troops he would have nowhere to run, and no time to warn his fellow rebels. While he is being detained, we can dismantle what is left of his base and wipe the slate clean.
mexico_calles.2.a코0=Put an end to his ideological crusade.

mexico_calles.4.t코0=FORMER MEXICAN PRESIDENT EXILED!
mexico_calles.4.d코0=Former President Plutarco Elias Calles, and 3 of his right hand men, have been arrested by orders of President [MEX.GetLeader]. Mexico's leftists have accused Calles of trying to ferment dissent among the right wing against President Cardenas, whom he calls a communist, and possibly force the country into a civil war. When the Mexican authorities stormed the rancho, they arrested Calles laying in his bed, reading a spanish Translation of Hitler's book "Mein kampf." Calles was then forced onto a plane in the dead of night, heading for Houston, Texas. Calles arrived in the morning, and is said to be on his way to San Diego where he will live with his sister.\n A cache of weapons, presumably for supplying rebels, were also recovered.
mexico_calles.4.a코0=I don't know what's going on in Mexico, but at this point I am too afraid to ask.
mexico_calles.4.b코0=They are not sending their best, folks.
mexico_calles.4.c코0=Calles got the same treatment he gave to so many others.

mexico_calles.5.t코0=FORMER MEXICAN PRESIDENT EXILED!

mexico_calles.5.b코0=They are not sending their best, folks.
mexico_calles.5.c코0=Calles got the same treatment he gave to so many others.

mexico_calles.6.t코0=Calles Rebellion!
mexico_calles.6.d코0=Callista supporters have begun a revolt in Mexico in response to what they call the "soviet-ification" of Mexico. Whipped into a frenzy by Plutarco's rhetoric, his supporters have plunged Mexico into yet another civil war. It remains to be seen if this rebellion reaches the brutality of the Mexican revolution, which tore Mexico apart for 10 years.
mexico_calles.6.a코0=Dios Mio.

mexico_pemex.1.t코0=Oil Worker Strikes
mexico_pemex.1.d코0=President [Root.GetLeader],  workers are striking against unfair treatment by the foreign companies that bought out the Aguila oil company. They have blatantly broken many of our laws before, and dealing with them will receive little to no backlash among Mexicans. It is best to nationalize the oil company under the constitutional statute that asserts our ownership over all natural resources. Oil nationalization would help fund our country's industrialization, and if war were to happen we would stand to make substantial profit.
mexico_pemex.1.a코0=Let's make a power play.

mexico_pemex.2.t코0=MEXICO NATIONALIZES OIL COMPANIES!
mexico_pemex.2.d코0=[MEX.GetLeader] has announced the nationalization of oil companies within Mexico. The previously foreign companies shall be confiscated and put under the control of PEMEX, the state run oil company. This disproportionately effects UK and Dutch companies, who are demanding their governments go to war. America is largely unsure whether to condone or condemn the nationalization, as the presence in the Mexican oil market was not only negligible, but the nationalization helps their business by eliminating foreign competition.
mexico_pemex.2.a코0=This is insane, Mexico will start a war!
mexico_pemex.2.b코0=Outrageous! They dare steal our propery?!
mexico_pemex.2.c코0=Now we wait and see their response.

mexico_pemex.3.t코0=Mexico nationalizes oil!
mexico_pemex.3.d코0=Mexico has announced the nationalization of any natural resource assets in the country. Lobbyists are demanding war, but it will get politically messy right when Germany's rising power is a much more clear threat. If we wage a war, we will have less manpower, and resources to deal with Germany. The terrain is rough, and it will likely be a drawn out war. Our other option is to embargo them and force them to return our holdings when Mexico realizes it doesn't have the expertise to run an oil company.
mexico_pemex.3.a코0=Declare War
mexico_pemex.3.b코0=Starve them out.

mexico_pemex.4.t코0=Mexico nationalizes oil!
mexico_pemex.4.d코0=Mexico has announced the nationalization of any natural resource assets in the country.

mexico_pemex.4.d코0=Starve them out.

mexico_pemex.5.t코0=U.S. embargoes Mexico!
mexico_pemex.5.d코0=President [USA.GetLeader] has announced that Mexico shall be embargoed in response to the nationalization of American Oil Companies in Mexico. Political Analysts call this an attempt starve out Mexico's state owned oil company, PEMEX, and force Mexico to return the nationalized assets.
mexico_pemex.5.a코0=Lets see if PEMEX survives.
mexico_pemex.5.b코0=They're trying to starve us out.

mexico_pemex.6.t코0=U.K. embargoes Mexico!
mexico_pemex.6.d코0=[ENG.GetLeader] has announced that Mexico shall be embargoed in response to the nationalization of English and Dutch Oil Companies in Mexico. Political Analysts call this an attempt starve out Mexico's state owned oil company, PEMEX, and force Mexico to return the nationalized assets.
mexico_pemex.6.a코0=Let us see if PEMEX survives.
mexico_pemex.6.b코0=They're trying to starve us out.

mexico_pemex.7.t코0=U.S. declares war on Mexico!
mexico_pemex.7.d코0=President [USA.GetLeader] has announced a declaration of war on Mexico over outrage over the confiscation of oil assets from American companies. [USA.GetLeader] has stated that it must defend American interests, and will not stand for Mexican posturing against American companies. [MEX.GetLeader] has responded that foreign ownership of the oil was not legal to begin with under Mexican law, and that any future president had the legal right to enforce the law. [MEX.GetLeader] has also stated that they will fight to protect their constitution from foreign interests.
mexico_pemex.7.a코0=My God.
mexico_pemex.7.b코0=Dios Mio.

mexico_pemex.8.t코0=UK declares war on Mexico!
mexico_pemex.8.d코0=The United Kingdom has declared a state of war on Mexico, over its nationalization of over 130 million dollars of assets. [ENG.GetLeader] has stated that "It does not matter if America is with us or against us, the United Kingdom will not be pushed around!" Needless to say, it seems Mexico is in a very tough spot.
mexico_pemex.8.a코0=My God.
mexico_pemex.8.b코0=Dios Mio.

mexico_pemex.9.t코0=Compensation
mexico_pemex.9.d코0=Now that we are under an embargo and war has been temporarily averted, it might be time to offer to pay 29 million dollars in reparations to America, who have been demanding compensation for the affected enterprises. This will fully avoid war with the United States and lift the embargo, but place a temporary strain on our budget. However, the expansion of our possible markets would outweigh the penalty.
mexico_pemex.9.a코0=They want compensation? I'd like to see them try.
mexico_pemex.9.b코0=Pay them compensation, and end this.

mexico_minor.2.t코0=Escobar returns to Mexico!
mexico_minor.2.d코0=José Gonzalo Escobar, the leader of the failed Escobar rebellion, has come out of his exile and is returning to his homeland of Mexico. Escobar stated he needs to be with his country in its time of need. Escobar was the leader of a failed coup during Mexico's Maximato, where he initially had success in the ground battles and was soundly defeated by Mexico's air force.
mexico_minor.2.a코0=Vive Mexico!
mexico_minor.2.b코0=Who? What?

mexico_minor.4.t코0=Mexico welcomes Spanish intellectuals
mexico_minor.4.d코0=[Root.GetLeader] has announced that he is welcoming the intellectuals that are fleeing the Spanish Civil war into the Mexican university system. A new campus, called "The House of Spain", will let the intellectuals continue their work. The campus was funded by a coalition of banks, federal bureaus, and special interests.
mexico_minor.4.b코0=Truly a humanitarian act.
mexico_minor.4.a코0=Build it, and they will come.

mexico_article_30.1.t코0=English diplomats request Jenkins arrested

mexico_article_30.2.t코0=Diplomatic Incident
mexico_article_30.2.d코0=UK diplomats are outraged and call for us to arrest William Jenkins for violating Article 30 of the constitution. They accuse him of tampering with Mexican politics by using his media monopoly to turn Mexicans against the United Kingdom. However, our sources say that Jenkins is merely refusing to publish most anti-German films in Mexico,with recent events backing the prudent move. The previous film published was "The Lion has Wings", a movie about the RAF raid on the Kiel Canal, drew such anger that Mexican cinemas were forced to remove the movie. William Jenkins, as far as we know, did nothing expressly wrong if pro-UK films were unpopular with Mexcian audiences. This situation could also be used to expel more than just Jenkins or the English, we would have an excuse to expel all of the lawbreakers in the nation to save face as we would not be laying blame on any one party. What should we do?
mexico_article_30.2.a코0=Expel William Jenkins
mexico_article_30.2.b코0=Expel the English
mexico_article_30.2.c코0=Expel all lawbreakers

mexico_article_30.3.t코0=Intelligence Report: William Jenkins 
mexico_article_30.3.d코0=UK diplomats are outraged and call for us to arrest William Jenkins for violating Article 30 of the constitution. They accuse him of tampering with Mexican politics by using his media monopoly to turn Mexicans against the United Kingdom. However the DFS says that Jenkins is linked to Maximino Camacho, and is protecting Jenkins politically in exchange for business opportunities. Maximino is a known axis sympathizer, and is said to have a photo of Mussolini hanging over his bed at his masnion in Pueblo. It is obvious that Maximino is using his leverage over Jenkins to stop non-fascist influence from gaining a foothold in Mexico. Pro-UK movies however are extremely unpopular with Mexican audiences and prompted Mexican cinemas to stop showing them in some instances. The decision to allow pro-UK movies would please the United Kingdom, but not the Mexican movie goer. This situation could also be used to expel more than just Jenkins or the English, we would have an excuse to expel all of the lawbreakers in the nation to save face as we would not be laying blame on any one party. What should we do?

mexico_zoot_suit.2.t코0=SLEEPY LAGOON MURDERS
mexico_zoot_suit.2.d코0=Sleepy Lagoon, a popular hangout and lover's lane for Mexican teens who are often denied admission to public pools, is the site of a grisly murder as the body of Mexican citizen and US serviceman José Díaz was found. Díaz was found unconscious, intoxicated, and suffered blunt force trauma. Diaz later died from his injuries at Los Angeles General Hospital. Police scoured the city for the culprits and arrested the leader of the 1th street gang, Hank Leyvas, his girlfriend Dora Barrios, and 1 other Mexican-Americans out of 600 Mexican Americans rounded up by LAPD. Hank denies any tie to the murder. Tensions have been running high in Los Angeles between Angelenos and Pachucos, otherwise known as zoot suiters, and it seems the tensions won't be resolved any time soon.
mexico_zoot_suit.2.a코0=A disgusting act.

mexico_zoot_suit.3.t코0=SLEEPY LAGOON TRIAL
mexico_zoot_suit.3.d코0=The trial of the Sleepy Lagoon murder begun today, with Hank and 2 others pleading not guilty. Hank pleaded that he and his girlfriend were attacked at Sleepy Lagoon that night by a group of men. Hank, assuming it was a gang related attack, called his gang to Sleepy Lagoon to find the muggers. They found a party near the site of the attack, and assuming it was a rival gang they confronted the partiers. A fight broke out between the gang and the partiers, lasting about 10 minutes. By morning, the body of Diaz was found. The coronor report states that Dia'z injuries are consistent with being hit by a car. The prosecution put forward E. Duran Ayres, chief of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Los Angeles sheriff's office, to state that Mexicans as a whole are bloodthirsty and contain a biological urge to kill past down from their Aztec ancestors.
mexico_zoot_suit.3.a코0=This won't end well.

mexico_zoot_suit.4.t코0=HANK CONVICTED
mexico_zoot_suit.4.d코0=The Sleepy Lagoon case has come to a close, as Hank and 16 others have been convicted of murder. The men of the gang are to be sent to San Quentin prison while their girlfriends, under suspiscion of accessory, were to be sent to the notorious Ventura School for Girls, a reformatory institution for deliquent and sexually promiscuous girls. Ventura's reputation is exceedingly harsh, and women sentenced there often attempt suicide before being transferred there. It is reported one girl has tried swallowing safety pins in an attempt to escape her sentence.
mexico_zoot_suit.4.a코0=Maybe tensions will die down now.

mexico_zoot_suit.5.t코0=ZOOT SUIT RIOTS
mexico_zoot_suit.5.d코0=Racial tensions have exploded in Los Angeles, as an altercation between a group of pachucos and US servicemen have erupted into a race riot. Thousands of US servicemen are leaving their bases in droves to participate in the riot, with some servicemen abandoning their post from as far away as Los Vegas to Riot in Los Angeles. Servicemen were seen raiding bars theaters and cafes to drag out Mexican youths, some of them children, to be stripped naked and beaten as their clothes were burned. A smaller mob has descended on the Black neighborhood of Watts, but there is no word on the scale of the damage done there. LAPD has refused to take action against the riots stating "Well, we represented public opinion. Many of us were in the First World War, and we're not going to pick on kids in the service." 
mexico_zoot_suit.5.a코0=Horrific.

mexico_zoot_suit.6.t코0=MEXICO OUTRAGED
mexico_zoot_suit.6.d코0=Mexico is outraged over the handling of the Zoot Suit riots, with nationalists stating that the attacks on Mexican citizens by the United States armed forces is an act of war. The nationalists are demanding their government to step in and declare war over this brazen act of aggression. The communist and left wing nationalists back this stance as well, saying what has been done cannot be forgiven. The situation has spiralled out of control, and it is not known whether Mexican-American diplomacy will ever recover.
mexico_zoot_suit.6.a코0=Things are getting out of control.

mexico_zoot_suit.7.t코0=Intel: Los Angeles, California
mexico_zoot_suit.7.d코0=We have devised a plan to use the Mexican immigrants immigrating to the United States to be informants for our intelligence services. Many left to escape the revolution, and some are even in the military! Its possible that we might find some Mexican patriots to pass along crucial information.
mexico_zoot_suit.7.a:=See what you can do.

mexico_faction.1.b코0=No.

mexico_communist.1.t코0=Report: Dioniso Encinia
mexico_communist.1.d코0=The PCM, from its inception, was created and funded by Soviet Russia. Dioniso is a Soviet puppet, and his presence is divisive. The PCM has splintered into many opposing communist parties entirely due to Dioniso's insecurity, purging members who might threaten his seat as the leader. Dioniso is entirely dependent on Soviet guidance, and the advice of his much more capable wife. A PCM led Mexico would be disastrous, not only creating a false government and puppet state but filling it with intentionally inept leadership. Currently, relations with the Soviets have remained nonexistent after the failed Soviet-backed coup in 1929, and the outlawing and dismantling of the PCM in the following years. They are however now growing as communist support is surging in Mexico. We cannot stop the rise of communism, but we can stop who will lead it. The attempted assassionation...
mexico_communist.1.a코0=Succeeds in killing Dioniso
mexico_communist.1.b코0=Fails in killing Dioniso

mexico_communist.2.t코0=Mexican government overthrown
mexico_communist.2.d코0=Riding off rising communist sentiment among popular culture, the Soviet backed PCM has successfully risen to power. Mexico is now a puppet state of the Soviet Union. American diplomats are outraged over brazen Soviet influence on their doorstep, and threaten war with the Mexican government and their Russian backers.
mexico_communist.2.a코0=Things have gotten out of hand.

mexico_communist.3.t코0=Mexican government overthrown
mexico_communist.3.d코0=Our attempts to install our puppet into power in Mexico, Dioniso Encina, has succeeded. The Mexican government has been overthrown after years of work. We now have a tangible foothold in the Americas, allowing us to project power into Latin America and even strike at the United States.
mexico_communist.3.a코0=Fantastic work!

mexico_1940.1.t코0=PRI Candidate
mexico_1940.1.d코0=The election is drawing closer, and we must put forward a candidate to campaign for the PRI against the right wing. Currently, there are two possible candidates. Fransisco Mugica is left wing, and more aligned with socialist ideals. Choosing Mugica would be a risk if popularity for socialist ideals are low. Manuel Ávila Camacho is the more centrist choice, and is more accepted by the right wing. However, choosing Camacho would stop any hope of left wing reforms passing.
mexico_1940.1.a코0=Choose Fransisco Mugica to run for president. (Communist choice)
mexico_1940.1.b코0=Choose Manuel Ávila Camacho to run for president. (Neutral choice)

mexico_1940.2.t코0=Right Wing Candidate
mexico_1940.2.d코0=The right wing is currently in a civil war between Juan Andreu Almazán and Joaquin Amaro over who should be the presidential candidate. Almazán is known more for being a noted businessman rather than a military figure, and draws in support mainly from wealthy Mexicans. However, his support among the working poor is abysmal as he is seen as offering nothing to them. Almazán's foreign policy is noticeably pro-US and further alianates average Mexicans. Amaro however is a famous military figure, and draws respect from the nationalists. Despite this, Almazán is seen as the inevitable choice for the right wing candidacy and Amaro's bid is quickly losing support to Almazán's campaign through a series of high profile defections. It is clear that Amaro will inevitably lose as Juan is backed by US interests and people find voting for a candidate that the US would try to overthrow is a fool's errand. However, there are people among the fascist cabal in Mexican politics who want to ensure that Almazán never lives to see election day. Maximino Ávila Camacho, brother to Manuel Ávila Camacho, has devised a plan to assassinate Juan Almazán at Plueba by staging an train accident.
mexico_1940.2.a코0=Juan Almazán runs for president. (Democratic choice)
mexico_1940.2.b코0=Juan Almazán dies, Amaro runs for president. (Fascist choice)

mexico_1940.3.t코0=MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE KILLED!
mexico_1940.3.d코0=Juan Almazán, the front runner to become the right wing presidential candidate has died in a train derailment in Plueba killing all those aboard. Almazán, a controversial figure, is no stranger to assassination attempts and has had multiple attempts on his life during the presidential campaign. His supporters have accused the PRI itself of orchestrating the derailment. Previously, Almazán was attacked by assassins wearing sarapes that hid machine guns while staying at the house of Fransisco Barbosa. His campaign claims he was attacked by an army of 100 assassins, and that he had to be stopped from running outside to fight them. Former general Alfredo Serratos however stated in an interview there were only 5 assassins.
mexico_1940.3.a코0=Horrific.

###DECISIONS

MEX_PEMEX_Situation코0=The PEMEX Embargo

MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC코0=[RECENTLY UPDATED]\n\nMexico stands at the closing days of the Maximato, the period when former president Plutarco Elias Calles held the true power in Mexico using right wing loyalists in both politics and the military. Since 1934, Lázaro Cárdenas del Río has waged a political war to end Plutarco's control over the country and enact his own left wing reforms. Mexico stands at a crossroads while the world prepares for war, as the left wing and right wing battle over control of the country's future and where it stands in the coming new world order.
MEX_BLITZKRIEG_DESC코0=[RECENTLY UPDATED]\n\nThe Maximato has ended and Calles is gone, but the battle between the left and right wings is still raging on. Emboldened by the economic hardship caused by the PEMEX embargoes, the right wing have become polarized and now exist in a state of political civil war over who will become the right wing candidate for the presidency next year. The dominant PRI however now rests at a choice between compromising their ideals with the moderate candidate Camacho or double down on the left wing candidate Mugica.

POLITICS_DIONISIO_ENCINA_DESC코0=Dionisio was described as a polarizing figure, and historians were often found to have very little positive things to say about his leadership. Dionisio was responsible for the fracturing of the largest Mexican communist party, the PCM. He was backed by Soviet agents in charge of spreading communism in Mexico and never acted unless ordered to, and feared that his Soviet handlers would find a more suitable leader for the PCM. This fear caused him to purge anyone who had better leadership skills or charisma from the PCM out of fear that he would be replaced by them, leaving the PCM with a severe lack of good leadership and proactive thinking.
