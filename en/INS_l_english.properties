indonesia.54.desc코0=It appears we mistook colonial indifferance to support, as our dutch partners have informed us that they see no need to change the status quo.
indonesia.54.a코0=At least they gave us an answer.
indonesia.10.t코0=Freedom for the East Indies?
indonesia.10.desc코0=Nationalistic sympathies have run high in our colonies, and begun to reach a breaking point. Democratic agitators in the East Indies have begun demanding for free elections and freedom from colonial control, but are willing for an alliance in the future. How do we react? 
indonesia.10.a코0=Better them than the communists.
indonesia.10.b코0=Ungrateful colonials!
indonesia.11.t코0=Freedom!
indonesia.11.desc코0=After days of strained and tense negotiations, the Dutch government have agreed for a full withdrawal and support for our democratic government, our freedom is at hand!
indonesia.11.a코0=Hari Kemerdekaan!
indonesia.12.t코0=Netherlands refuse
indonesia.12.desc코0=Despite our greatest efforts, our freedom has been denied. Indonesian representatives have been ignored and the Volksraad immediately shut down, diplomacy has failed us.
indonesia.12.a코0=Very well...
indonesia.12.b코0=We shall liberate ourselves by force!
indonesia.13.t코0=An unlikely ally
indonesia.13.desc코0=Communist agitators have been present in the East Indies for some time, but only now have things reached a breaking point. The communist party of Indonesia has asked us for our support in independence, wanting the might of the soviet union at the negotiating table. How do we reply?
indonesia.13.a코0=Let us welcome a new brother to the revolution!
indonesia.13.b코0=Their time has not yet come.
indonesia.14.t코0=The Soviet Union agrees!
indonesia.14.desc코0=Diplomats from the kremlin have agreed to attend independence talks with the Netherlands, our freedom is close at hand!
indonesia.14.a코0=Glory to the worldwide revolution!
indonesia.15.t코0=The Soviets refuse
indonesia.15.desc코0=Despite our best efforts, no guarantee from the Soviet Union has emerged, though they are sympathetic to our plight, they refuse to entangle themselves in Southeast Asian affairs.
indonesia.15.a코0=We must accept their decision
indonesia.15.b코0=The revolution will succeed without them!
indonesia.16.t코0=The Soviet Union supports Indonesian autonomy
indonesia.16.desc코0=In a strange turn of events, communist agitators in the East Indies have secured Soviet support for their movement, demands are now being made independence talks, with the Russians acting as mediators for the event. What should we do?
indonesia.16.a코0=Very well, we cannot risk further escalation
indonesia.16.b코0=This nonsense has gone on long enough!
indonesia.17.t코0=Freedom!
indonesia.17.desc코0=After days of strained and tense negotiations, the Dutch government have agreed for a full withdrawal of Dutch forces and the immediate instatement of a communist government, our freedom is at hand!
indonesia.17.a코0=Hari Kemerdekaan!
indonesia.18.t코0=Netherlands refuse
indonesia.18.desc코0=Even with the Soviet Union on our side, the Netherlands still have not seen fit to give us our independence, perhaps they've called our bluff, or maybe they are just stubborn, either way, we are left with a decision to make.
indonesia.18.a코0=It is time to back down.
indonesia.18.b코0=It is time for REVOLUTION!
indonesia.19.t코0=A curious request
indonesia.19.desc코0=Nationalism has reached a fever pitch in the East Indies, and our brothers cry out for liberation. Fascist leaders in Indonesia have reached out to us for an agreement, asking for protection and alliance should war break out. How should we respond?
indonesia.19.a코0=Well this certainly makes things easier.
indonesia.19.b코0=An unnecessary distraction from our own designs.
indonesia.20.t코0=The Agreement
indonesia.20.desc코0=The deal has been struck, alliances forged, Japan has our backs.
indonesia.20.a코0=Hari Kemerdekaan!
indonesia.21.t코0=Japanese support for Indonesian autonomy
indonesia.21.desc코0=Not surprisingly, Japan has always had an interest in our Asian colonies, claiming to represent Indonesian interests, they have demanded the full independence of Indonesia alongside its immediate inclusion into the Japanese sphere of influence. We could refuse their demands, but that would probably just make things worse.
indonesia.21.a코0=Better this than war.
indonesia.21.b코0=Let's see them try it!
indonesia.22.t코0=Worrying refusal
indonesia.22.desc코0=Despite our clear sympathies and support, the Japanese have not seen fit to back our bid for independence, maybe they don't believe the time is right, but is more likely that they have different, unforeseen plans for us.
indonesia.22.a코0=With friends like these...
indonesia.22.b코0=Indonesia has no need for fake allies, our freedom is at hand!
indonesia.23.t코0=Freedom!
indonesia.23.desc코0=After days of strained and tense negotiations, the Dutch government have agreed for a full withdrawal of Dutch forces and the immediate instatement of a nationalist government, our freedom is at hand!
indonesia.23.a코0=Hari Kemerdekaan!
indonesia.24.t코0=Netherlands refuse
indonesia.24.desc코0=Even with Japanese support, the Netherlands have still refused to grant our freedom. Perhaps they believe The Japanese will be too busy to intervene, or perhaps they are just foolish, either way, we have a decision to make.
indonesia.24.a코0=We are done here
indonesia.24.b코0=We don't need their permission for freedom!
indonesia.25.t코0=A singular demand
indonesia.25.desc코0=Nationalism has grown strong in our colonies, and unfortunately has reached a breaking point, protestors have taken to the streets, demand independence from the motherland, It gone too far to pass off any longer what should we do?
indonesia.25.a코0=Give them their freedom, if they want it so much.
indonesia.25.b코0=Hahaha, no.
indonesia.26.t코0=Freedom!
indonesia.26.desc코0=After days of strained and tense negotiations, the Dutch government have agreed for a full withdrawal of Dutch forces and the immediate instatement of an independent government, our freedom is at hand!
indonesia.26.a코0=Hari Kemerdekaan!
indonesia.27.t코0=Netherlands refuse
indonesia.27.desc코0=Despite our protests, the Netherlands have remained silent. Our protesters dispersed, and our members flung from the Volksraad. The message sent is clear.
indonesia.27.a코0=Our time will come...
indonesia.27.b코0=And it will come now!
indonesia.27.c코0=And it will come now!

indonesia.30.t코0=Indonesia claims Borneo!
indonesia.30.desc코0=Our shared border with the East Indies on the island of Borneo has always been a tense, but restrained affair. Now, however, tensions have come to a breaking point, with the new Indonesian government demanding full control and sovreignty of the island. What should we do?
indonesia.30.a코0=Give in to their demands.
indonesia.30.b코0=Their independence has made them headstrong, ignore them.
indonesia.31.t코0=Malaya submits!
indonesia.31.desc코0=Our threats worked, Malaya has surrendered any claims to Borneo and control is being transferred to us immediately.
indonesia.31.a코0=A victory for diplomacy!
indonesia.32.t코0=Malaya refuses!
indonesia.32.desc코0=Despite our best efforts, diplomacy has failed, Malaya has ignored all our demands and continues as if nothing has changed.

indonesia.40.t코0=Indonesia petitions for colonial freedom.
indonesia.40.desc코0=The world has changed vastly since the Great War, and the time of colonial empires is almost at an end. The recently independent Indonesia is an example of this, and diplomats from the country have asked us to allow our colonial holdings in Southeast Asia independence, in exchange for a guarantee of Indonesian protection. What should we make of this offer?
indonesia.40.a코0=We must not stop the march of democracy
indonesia.40.b코0=We know what is best for our subjects.
indonesia.41.t코0=The United States have agreed!
indonesia.41.desc코0=Seeing the wisdom in our request, the United States have agreed to support full autonomy of the Philippines and it's diplomatic alliance with our faction. Today is a great day for democracy in Asia!
indonesia.41.a코0=A victory of diplomacy!
indonesia.42.t코0=Independence!
indonesia.42.desc코0=Our brothers in Indonesia have not taken their newfound independence for granted; they have petitioned the United States for the full independence of our nation, and have guaranteed our place in a diplomatic alliance. With the USA's blessing, our freedom is here!
indonesia.42.a코0=To MalPhiIndo!

indonesia.43.t코0=The United Kingdom Agrees!

indonesia.46.t코0=Australian control of the East Indies
indonesia.46.desc코0=In a surprising move, the Australian government has petitioned and won the right to protect our colony for the Dutch. While they no doubt mean well, it is simply trading one foreign master for another, what should we do?
indonesia.46.a코0=Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
indonesia.46.b코0=Now's our chance to break away!

#whitepeace
indonesia.50.t코0=The war with Germany...
indonesia.50.desc코0=It appears that through no fault of our own, we are at war. This is not the greatest of situations, and enthusiam in our colony for the war abroad is very low. If possible it would be beneficial for our longterm independence goals if negotiated a peace with Gemrany.
indonesia.50.a코0=Give peace a chance!
indoneisa.50.b코0=We shall fight on!
indonesia.51.t코0=Peace with the East Indies?
indonesia.51.desc코0=Although nowhere near our theatres of battle, it appears that we through colonial ties, the nation of Indonesia is at war with us. Negotiators have contacted us to broker a peace.

indonesia.51.a코0=One less problem to worry about.
indoneisa.51.b코0=We shall conquer them in due time.
indonesia.52.t코0=Germany refuses!
indonesia.52.desc코0=Unsurprisingly, it appears that Germany cares little of us, and views a protracted war as a mere inconveniance at best. It appears that we are in this for the long haul.

indonesia.53.t코0=Germany accepts!
indonesia.53.desc코0=Viewing a war in Southeast Asia as unnecessary, the germans have agreed to our peace offer.

#INS renames cities
indonesia.100.t코0=Removing the colonialist influence
indonesia.100.desc코0=Now that we are independent, a good first step in showcasing our autonomy would be changing the names of some of our cities. Dutch influence has no place in our new nation.
indonesia.100.a코0=It shall be done!
indonesia.100.b코0=I like Hollandia...

#civil war whitepeace
indonesia.101.t코0=Time for peace?
indonesia.101.desc코0=Our civil war has gone on for months, and while our cause is righteous, it may be pragmatic to look for a peace so we can stabilize our nation. Enough time has passed for diplomatic entreaties to be possible, should we broker a peace?
indonesia.101.a코0=It is time for peace.
indoneisa.101.b코0=We shall fight till the last!
indonesia.102.t코0=An offer of peace.
indonesia.102.desc코0=Our war in Indonesia has stagnated, and a clear victory is not yet certain, an offer for peace from the enemy has been brokered, asking for a ceasefire. How shall we respond?
indonesia.102.a코0=War is in nobody's best interest, we shall agree.
indoneisa.102.b코0=They offer peace because they know we will win, fight on!
indonesia.103.t코0=Peace accepted!
indonesia.103.desc코0=Our entreaties have been successful, a ceasefire is being negotiated to end current hostilities in Indonesia, for how long, is up to us.
indonesia.103.a코0=Diplomacy shall carry us far.

indonesia.104.a코0=Diplomacy never did us any good anyway.

indonesia.105.t코0=The new governor
indonesia.105.desc코0=The retirement of Cornelis de Jonge as Governor-general of the East Indies marks the end of an era. A strong, stubborn man, Jonge was firmly opposed to local autonomy and was also firmly pro-Dutch in his administration, rejecting most efforts to increase colonial autonomy. His replacement, Stachouwer, has yet to decide which way he will point the administration, but many are hoping for a breath of fresh air to kickstart independence movements.
indonesia.105.a코0=May he govern well.

indonesia.106.t코0=Kebangkitan
indonesia.106.desc코0=The Netherlands East Indies lies at a crossroads, though sheltered from the great war, the colonial administration has not escaped the growing movements for native independence. Fueled by the rising power of Japan and the growing modernisation of the colony, native figures have arisen championing Independence under many banners. From the East, the fascist pro-Japanese champion the Right of Nationhood, the workers demand greater control over the fruits of their labour, and even the most sympathetic politicans are demanding a true democratic government. Whether the overburdened and undersupported colonial government will be able to quell these demands, or fall under wave of Independence, only time will tell.
indonesia.106.a코0=We zullen handhaven.

INS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC코0=Indonesia may seem to be a stable colony for the inattentive observer, but for those living there, the situation is much more tense. The colonial regime is maintained by a mix of repression of the natives while maintaining close ties to their aristocracy. But since the beginning of the century, nationalist organization have started to appear and demand more autonomy and rights. The most radicals are demanding the end of the colonial rule and are looking from support through revolutionary ideologies.
