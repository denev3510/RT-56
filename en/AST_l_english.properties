Earle Page, leader of the Country Party and deputy Prime Minister has been chose to serve as interim Prime Minister until the UAP are able to vote on their new leader.\n\nAt the age of 59, Lyons was complementing his retirement and wished to spend more time with his young children, however the lack of successor lead to the party pressuring him to stay.

r56_australia.13.t코0=Robert Menzies Resigns

Having lost all support from parliament, he has stepped down.\n\nDespite Menzies advising the Governor-General to make John Curtin Prime Minister, a joint UAP-Country Party conference chose Country Party leader Arthur Fadden as the new Coalition leader and Prime Minister. Bitter and dejected, Robert Menzies almost quit politics but was persuaded to become Minister for Defence Co-ordination in Arthur Fadden's new cabinet.

r56_australia.14.t코0=Vote of no Confidence
r56_australia.14.d코0=After only 40 days as Prime Minister, Arthur Fadden has been defeated in a vote of no confidence lead by the Labor opposition. Having been unable to secure the confidence of parliament, his death-nail came when the House of Representatives rejected his proposed budget.

r56_australia.19.d코0=The idea of New Zealand being a state of Australia has existed since before the founding of our nations, however fear it was never too be.

The island, known for it's phosphate mining, was annexed by the British in 1888 and has been under the governorship of the Straits Settlements. It is home to a significant number of Malayan workers and it acts as a safe harbour for any ships seeking shelter in the Eastern and Southern Indian Ocean.
