SWE_motti_tactic코0=Active Defense
SWE_motti_tactic_desc코0=Realistically, even with our top-quality weapons and tactics, Sweden couldn't hope to win a fair fight against any of Europe's great powers. The Finns have developed what they call ''Motti tactics'', defensive guerrilla-style tactics, and studying them could help us if worst comes to worst.

SWE_kings_council코0=The King in Council
SWE_kings_council_desc코0=The King in Council or "Konungen i Statsrådet" gives the King the ability to dismiss and reform the Cabinet at will. While it may not be popular, or particularly democratic, our wise King's rule may be the only thing that can guide us through the turmoil of modern times.
SWE_convoy_focus코0=Protect the Merchant Sailors
SWE_convoy_focus_desc코0=The Swedish economy is based on exports and imports. If our merchant fleet is to be sunk, our nation might be as well. We must focus our Naval efforts on convoys and their protection!

SWE_nationalism_focus코0=NSAP Coalition Government
SWE_nationalism_focus_desc코0=Our recent move on the Åland issue has emboldened the NSAP. Their support with the populace and (worryingly) the military is growing, and it seems like to keep any control, the ruling party will have to include them in the governing coalition.
SWE_internationalism_focus코0=SKP Coalition Government
SWE_internationalism_focus_desc코0=The SKP has surprisingly applauded our revocation of the Åland convention, calling it a great victory against Capitalists and Imperialists. Their propaganda is starting to effect the public, and a coalition may be our best hope for stability.

SWE_arrest_royalists코0=The Red-Blue Revolution
SWE_arrest_royalists_desc코0=The people cannot wait for the Bourgeois government to step down! Though Communist support only holds a plurality, SKP partisans are now ready to arrest or execute anyone standing against them- even if that means everyone in the government who knows what they're doing...
SWE_abolish_monarchy코0=Abolish the Monarchy
SWE_abolish_monarchy_desc코0=Even if our King will allow Communists in parliament, how can a Communist nation have a rich King? We must end the farce of a Swedish monarchy and send that crooked aristocrat into exile.
SWE_facket코0=Folkhemmet
SWE_facket_desc코0=Swedish Communism is the way forward! We cannot let misguided reactionaries like the Soviets hold the people's revolution back! We will join with our Brothers to spread the red cause!
SWE_norway_friend코0=Fund Norwegian Communists
SWE_norway_friend_desc코0=Our neighbor Norway is fertile soil to grow Communism in further. We could even specifically support Internationalists, who may seek a union with our nation!
SWE_ideological_propaganda코0=Ideological Propaganda

SWE_deal_soviet코0=A Deal with the USSR
SWE_deal_soviet_desc코0=The Russians have never exactly been friendly towards Sweden, but Fascism is a much more dire enemy to face. If we agree to support their claims on Finnish territory, we may bury the hatchet yet- and get a free hand in Norway to boot.

SWE_norway_unification코0=Scandinavian Socialist Union
SWE_norway_unification_desc코0=The Norwegian communists are begging for our more enlightened rule, eager to reverse the humiliation of 1905 imposed upon them by societal elites! Once their position in their Parliament is secure, we can demand the union!

SWE_support_iceland_rebels코0=Supply Icelandic Nationalists
SWE_support_iceland_rebels_desc코0=Iceland is suffering greatly under the weak and ineffective rule of the Danish state, whether they realize it or not. There exists a core of nationalists on the island, and the only merciful act is to arm them.
SWE_iceland_rebel_uprising코0=Icelandic Mutiny
SWE_iceland_rebel_uprising_desc코0=The Icelandic Independence Movement has come to a head. Armed and trained nationalists are waiting for our signal to free themselves of Danish yoke. Of course, the Danish might react negatively to this...
SWE_strb코0=Stridsbåtar
SWE_strb_desc코0=Develop small, agile boats armed with machineguns and plenty of space to transport our Marines and speed up invasions.
SWE_axis_leanings_focus코0=Axis Leanings
SWE_axis_leanings_focus_desc코0=The Germans are our kin, yet despite this, we spent much of the last few centuries fighting them. No longer. Sweden and Germany will band together against the Bolsheviks and their cabal!
SWE_technology_sharing_axis코0=Krupp-Landsverk
SWE_technology_sharing_axis_desc코0=German technology impresses even those in the Svea Rike. If we were to support a merger between Krupp and Landsverk, the new conglomerate will give us access to some of these futuristic German toys.
SWE_found_own_empire코0=Our Own Empire
SWE_found_own_empire_desc코0=Sweden was once the most feared nation in all of Europe. Germans, Finns, Russians, Brits, all bent the knee or paid the price. They've forgotten. They've all forgotten. But we...we'll make them remember.


SWE_bofors_nobelkrut코0=Bofors Nobelkrut
#SWE_bofors_nobelkrut:0 "Encourage Domestic Arms Manufacturing"
SWE_bofors_nobelkrut_desc코0=Bofors is our pride and joy, a respected name in artillery worldwide. The Nobelkrut subsidiary shows plenty of potential for expansion, allowing for more guns produced and more bright minds designing them.
SWE_undk코0=Organize the FRA
SWE_undk_desc코0=Swedish Intelligence services are modern and numerous, but are a bureaucratic nightmare, being spread and subject to various military branches and institutions. We would gain much from a unified, centralized Intelligence service- the FRA.
#SWE_undk:0 "Intelligence Agency FRA"
#SWE_undk_desc:0 "Implement the Intelligence Office of the Defence Staff to reduce foreign subversive activity. UNDK is short for Underrättelsekontoret which is part of Försvarsstaben."

#SWE_amfss:0 "Coastal Artillery School"
SWE_amfss_desc코0=The Kustartilleriets Skjutskola, contrary to its name, teaches students in the way of amphibious warfare- if we are to make any naval landings, encouraging its growth and patronage is crucial.
SWE_amfss코0=Coastal Gunnary School KAS
SWE_bofors_naval_guns코0=Bofors Naval Guns
SWE_bofors_naval_guns_desc코0=Bofors artillery expertise is reknown for its AA guns but it also included the guns the Swedish navy.
SWE_musko_bas코0=Archipelago Bases
SWE_crypto_bomb_focus코0=Geheimfernschreiber Cipher
SWE_crypto_bomb_focus_desc코0=Arne Beurling, a mathematician from Uppsala University, has some interesting ideas about how to crack the Enigma code used by the Germans. Perhaps if we gave him some Government support, he could put his ideas into practice.
SWE_stuka_effort코0=Nydqvist & Holm Flygmotorfabriker
#SWE_stuka_effort:0 "StuKa Operations"
SWE_stuka_effort_desc코0=As the German Luftwaffe has many constraints put upon it after the treaty of Versailles, the Germans wish to practice StuKa dive-bombing operations in Sweden in which we are welcome to join.
SWE_synth_oil코0=Skifferoljeaktiebolaget
SWE_army_effort코0=Arméstaben
SWE_army_effort_desc코0=Currently, the top ranking official of the Swedish Army is the Head of State- and not in a ceremonial way either. Delegating the top tier of command to the Överbefälhavaren, or Supreme Commander, will help our military's modernization efforts.
SWE_doctrine_effort_2코0=Modern Command Structure
SWE_doctrine_effort_2_desc코0=Our restructuring of the Swedish officer positions has begun to pay dividends. Officers with interesting tactical and strategic ideas are popping up left and right, strengthening our doctrine.
SWE_doctrine_effort_3코0=Royal Military Academy Karlberg
SWE_doctrine_effort_3_desc코0=The Royal Military Academy of Karlberg is an important factor in our military modernization, and the young, upcoming commanders should be given a platform, strengthening our grasp on military theory.
SWE_equipment_effort코0=Fund Carl Gustafs Gevärsfaktori
SWE_equipment_effort_desc코0=Carl Gustafs Gevärsfaktori has been designing equipment for Swedish infantry for a long time now, and an expansion of their facility and increase in government support is well due by this point.
SWE_equipment_effort_2코0=Found the ArtSS
SWE_equipment_effort_2_desc코0=Artillery is an educated man's weapon, requiring a unique combination of trigonometry and battle sense. The Artilleriets skjutskola, an organization training our artillerymen, could do more with a proper facility.
SWE_rocket_effort코0=Reaktions Motor
#SWE_rocket_effort:0 "Jet-Motor"
SWE_rocket_effort_desc코0=Start the devleopment of jet-engines that can power both modern aircraft and ballistic misslies.
SWE_nuclear_effort코0=Kärnvapenprogrammet
SWE_nuclear_effort_desc코0=The Soviets, the Germans, the British...Who knows what the enemy of the future will be? If we research and construct Nuclear weapons, we can be sure no one will think about making a colony out of Stockholm.
SWE_ski_troops코0=Winter Equipment
SWE_ski_troops_desc코0=A rare advantage of having a relatively small army is ease in testing and distribution of new equipment. Trials in the Lappland have shown us what works, and we can

SWE_mechanization_effort_desc코0=The Pansarterrängbilar vehicles are capable of transporting Infantry in even the most miserable conditions- great for dealing with the snow and mountains within our borders.
SWE_armor_effort코0=Contract Landsverk
SWE_armor_effort_desc코0=Landsverk has several engineers proposing designs for construction and use- and if we contract their production, we could receive a tank that would even make the Germans jealous.
SWE_aviation_effort코0=Flygvapnet Modernization
SWE_aviation_effort_desc코0=The Swedish Air Force is small even for how small the Swedish military in general is, and worse yet, is made up of small, random amounts of foreign models. If the Swedish Air Force is to become a threat of any kind, we have to fix its shortcomings.
SWE_fighter_focus코0=Flygverkstäderna
SWE_fighter_focus_desc코0=The last war demonstrated the importance of air superiority. Enemy aircraft could do untold damage to Swedish territory, so making sure we have modern Fighters to keep them out should be priority.
SWE_bomber_focus코0=SAAB Twin Engine Planes
SWE_bomber_focus_desc코0=SAAB is a naturally gifted firm when it comes to dealing with modern Aluminum aircraft. We should commission more of those fancy twin-engine aircraft from them.
SWE_jet_fighter_focustree코0=The Barrel & The Lance
SWE_jet_fighter_focustree_desc코0=SAAB is not only gifted when it comes to aluminum, but it seems jet engines as well. Engineers are proposing amazing designs which could astound the world!
SWE_CAS_effort코0=Dive Bombers
SWE_CAS_effort_desc코0=Small, cheap Bombers can help us deal with enemy tanks or defensive installations at minimal cost. Their design and production is paramount!
SWE_NAV_effort코0=Torpedo Bombers
SWE_NAV_effort_desc코0=Torpedo Bombers are a feared force in the Baltic Sea, being able to sink a Capital Ship at a fraction of the cost. If we focus R&D into this field, we can master the seas!
SWE_bulltofta코0=Bulltofta & Kavaheden
SWE_bulltofta_desc코0=Build the Airfields of Bulltofta near Malmö and Kavaheden in Lapland. Sweden is vast and it is absolutely essential to have numerous Airfields in order to reach aerial superiority.
SWE_ornen코0=Pilot Academy FlygS
SWE_ornen_desc코0=Keeping an aircraft in the sky, especially in harsh Scandinavian weather, is quite difficult indeed. Assembling the best, brightest, and most enthusiastic students into one academy will give us a bumper crop of experts.
SWE_geting코0=Manoeuvre Getingen
SWE_bulldog코0=Combat Pilots
SWE_bulldog_desc코0=Implement Pilot training program Bulldogen to practice manoeuvres which will increase capabilities for several aircraft classes.
SWE_j22_steel_fighter코0=J-22 Steel Fighter
SWE_j22_steel_fighter_desc코0=Order Bo Lundgren to construct a Steel-framed version of the J-22, to fill the need of fighter aircraft inspite of the current Aluminium shortages. This fighter is comparable to the 1940's SpitFire and uses steel instead of aluminium as raw material.
#SWE_support_the_industry:0 "Iron Ore Line"
SWE_support_the_industry코0=Northern Railways
SWE_support_the_industry_desc코0=The North of Sweden is where most of our valuable metal is mined, but the infrastructure makes it difficult to transport- or god forbid, defend. New rails and roads will be of great benefit.
SWE_southern_infrastructure코0=Southern Railways
SWE_southern_infrastructure_desc코0=It's a long voyage from the Öresund to Stockholm. Better infrastructure will help us ship anything- materials, perhaps troops- at a more desirable pace.
SWE_planned_expansion코0=Finance State-owned Enterprises
SWE_planned_expansion_desc코0=The Free Market is all well and good, but sometimes they fail to provide, and the State must intervene. Subsidizing businesses will increase productivity and lower unemployment.
SWE_scania_rubber코0=Trelleborg Rubber Factory
SWE_scania_rubber_desc코0=Trelleborgs Gummifabrik produces that always-crucial Rubber for our military, mostly in the form of tires. Sponsorship and some public investment will help increase their output.
SWE_mining코0=SAKO Expansion
SWE_mining_desc코0=The Swedish Aluminum Company is looking to expand its processing capabilities by building a processing plant in Sundsvall. If we sponsor the expansion, we'll be rewarded with increased stockpiles of Aluminum.
SWE_construction_effort_I코0=Ball Bearing Factory
SWE_construction_effort_I_desc코0=Swedish Ball Bearings are of very high quality and are being used in advanced machinery across the world. If we further invest in their production, it will increase our gross economic output.
SWE_production_effort_I코0=Organize the Mechanical Works
SWE_production_effort_I_desc코0=The Mechanical Works are a group of manufacturing companies delivering parts and resources to industries as important as SAAB, Bofors, and even our military as a whole. Centralizing them will help our military production capabilities.
SWE_substitute_aluminium코0=Aluminium Substitute
SWE_substitute_aluminium_desc코0=To cope with the heavy demand and low supply of Aluminium, several Government efforts such as recycling and re-working steel into an anluminium substitute have to be implemented.
SWE_industry_research코0=Industrial Research
SWE_industry_research_desc코0=Our industrial expansion and other recent advances might allow us to conduct more R&D in parallel.
SWE_extra_tech_slot_2코0=Research Institute FOA
#SWE_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "Millitary Research"
SWE_extra_tech_slot_2_desc코0=The Swedish state is investing in many different fields of military research directly. Some of our scientists are proposing a unified institute- the FOA- to help speed things up.
#SWE_secret_weapons:0 "Försvarets Forskningsanstalt"
SWE_secret_weapons코0=Research Institute FOA
SWE_secret_weapons_desc코0=It is tempting to expend all extra resources into developing tanks and planes, but the secret to winning wars lies in whole new fields of science; electronics, rocketry and nuclear research.
SWE_naval_effort코0=Stockholms Örlogsvarv
#SWE_naval_effort:0 "Stockholm Shipyards"
#SWE_naval_effort:0 "Marinverkstäderna"
SWE_naval_effort_desc코0=Almost any nation who would attack Sweden would have to traverse the Baltic Sea first. Therefore, a large, modern Navy is needed to protect our nation.
SWE_flexible_navy코0=Marinstaben
SWE_flexible_navy_desc코0=Reinventing naval warfare to account for the advances in submarine technology will allow us to strike efficiently against enemy convoys.
SWE_large_navy코0=Evaluate Naval Doctrine
SWE_large_navy_desc코0=Historically, our navy has avoided open confrontation with enemy fleets, preferring to lure them into friendly terrain and smash them. This may not be effective in 20th century warfare, and we need to change with the times.
SWE_baltic_dominance코0=Control the Baltic Sea
SWE_baltic_dominance_desc코0=Its is essential to our interests to control the Baltic Sea as best we can. If possible we would strive to dominate this Region to protect our extensive shoreline.
SWE_capital_ships코0=Refurbish Cruisers
SWE_capital_ships_desc코0=Cruisers are cheap enough to be plentiful, even with limited facilities, and can help us control our coastline. We should invest in newer, better models for our own protection.
SWE_destroyer_effort코0=Order Modern Destroyers
#SWE_destroyer_effort:0 "Jagare"
SWE_destroyer_effort_desc코0=Our Destroyers are among the best in the world- even John Bull feels a touch of envy for them. Technology marches on, however, and we have to stay on top of research if we are to stay atop the mountain.
#SWE_sea_wolves:0 "Wolfpack"
SWE_sea_wolves코0=Ubåtsflottiljen
SWE_sea_wolves_desc코0=Submarines are the great equalizer, giving even smaller navies the opportunity to cause massive amounts of trouble. If we can put cheap, modern Subs to work, we can starve our enemies out!

SWE_osterbotten코0=Swedish Consolidation
SWE_osterbotten_desc코0=Swedes are at least a noteworthy minority everywhere the Blue and Gold once flew. If we are to be a great empire, we have to lay claim to this land- Finland would be a good start, for instance.
SWE_infrastructure코0=Southern Railways
SWE_infrastructure_desc코0=It's a long voyage from the Öresund to Stockholm. Better infrastructure will help us ship anything- materials, perhaps troops- at a more desirable pace.
SWE_production_effort_II코0=Develop the Aircraft Industry
SWE_production_effort_II_desc코0=Our Civilian aircraft industry has taken off in recent years and is starting to produce competitive aircraft for the international market. Given our Air Force's rather paltry state, perhaps putting them to work for us will help fill the skies with numbers.
#SWE_production_effort_II:0 "Flygmotorfabriker"
SWE_bomb_defence코0=Bergrum
SWE_motorized_focus코0=Motorized Standardization
SWE_planned_expansion_II코0=Public Construction Investments
SWE_planned_expansion_II_desc코0=It is difficult enough to find Swedes willing to do a job, much less construct a workplace. Financing construction companies will make that job a lot easier, and help with our own industrial construction.
SWE_planned_expansion_III코0=Industiral Expansion



SWE_lottorna코0=Lottorna
SWE_lottorna_desc코0=It is hard to argue that we need more soldiers, yet we have capable fighting men doing jobs like cooking and manning radio stations. We already have women in these ranks- making them exclusively female (and getting the lazy bastards in fighting shape) will bolster our numbers.
SWE_neutrality_focus코0=Scandinavian Isolation
SWE_neutrality_focus_desc코0=We cannot be tempted by expansionism and extremism. Sweden's position was Scandinavian democracy, peace, and neutrality, and it will stay that way.
#SWE_fortify_skargard:0 "Kustartilleriet"
SWE_fortify_skargard코0=Coastal Artillery
SWE_fortify_skargard_desc코0=Since almost all of our population centers are on the coast, a naval invasion is a scary prospect. Organized Coastal Fort construction will keep the Swedish people safe.
SWE_fortify_scania코0=Skånelinjen
SWE_fortify_scania_desc코0=While the opposition in Parliament would waste no time belittling efforts to fortify Scania, it is one of the most likely targets in case of war. We must build the region's defenses up- just in case.
SWE_airfields_gotland코0=Gotska Flygfält
SWE_airfields_gotland_desc코0=Construct a series of airfields and anit-aircraft guns on Gotland
SWE_tornea_line코0=Kalixlinjen
SWE_tornea_line_desc코0=Hypothetically, what if the Soviets roll over Finland and decide we're next? We would be fools not to build defenses on our Northeastern border.

SWE_liberty_ethos코0=Export Based Economy
SWE_liberty_ethos_desc코0=A grand, worldwide PR campaign is a simple and effective way to make sure that even when the great powers are fighting each other, they will at least have the fact that they buy Swedish goods in common.
SWE_intervention코0=Foreign Involvement
SWE_intervention_desc코0=Look outword and strengthen your leverage in Scandinavia.
SWE_alliance_finland코0=Åbo Conference
SWE_alliance_finland_desc코0=Finland is a far more defensible region than Sweden is, that much is certain. While our people may turn our noses up at our ''brothers'' to the east, an alliance could save both of our nations from the Russian bear.

SWE_finalnd_arms_production_desc코0=Cooperate in the small arms production with Finalnd to make efficiency gains.
SWE_baltic_refugees코0=Nordic Evacuees

SWE_demand_aland코0=Demand Åland
SWE_demand_aland_desc코0=The Finns are between a rock and a hard place. Åland, a Swedish-majority archipelago, is owned by Finland- and surely they can't take us and the Russians on at the same time over a little archipelago...
SWE_befriend_denmark코0=Copenhagen Treaty
SWE_befriend_denmark_desc코0=Scandinavia must be united, or Scandinavia will be wiped out by hostile forces. Alone, we could not hope to fight the Great Powers- but perhaps together, we can hold out.
SWE_danish_factory_alliance코0=Danish Industrial Cooperation
SWE_danish_factory_alliance_desc코0=Cooperate with the Danes to streamline factory output.

SWE_norway_war_goal코0=Annex Norway
SWE_norway_war_goal_desc코0=Norway declared independence from Sweden in 1905 and has been a sovereign Nation ever since. The political discourse has grown hard and the considerable differences might force us to intervene and control their independence.
SWE_germany_friend코0=German Cooperation
SWE_germany_friend_desc코0=German power in Europe is an ever growing force, by cooperating we can gain better relations to the Germans. 
SWE_soviet_war_goal코0=Ösel Crisis
SWE_estonia_war_goal코0=Ösel Crisis
SWE_estonia_war_goal_desc코0=Ösel and Dagö are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally Swedish. Basic logic dictates that the region is rightfully ours- and if the occupiers won't relent, we'll take the islands back- and Estonia as punishment!
SWE_militarism코0=Millitarism
SWE_german_tank_production코0=German Armor Cooperation
SWE_german_tank_production_desc코0=In the face of the greater good the Germans are ready to help us in our war effort to streamline the production of light tanks.

SWE_foreign_expeditions코0=Frivilligkåren
SWE_foreign_expeditions_desc코0=Elements of our military have been asking to form volunteer battalions with those fighting righteous foreign wars. Perhaps, through them, we can actually export stability...
SWE_war_bonds코0=Recycling
SWE_war_bonds_desc코0=Sweden, more than ever, needs resources for constructing defenses and sustaining exports. Our people are suffering from lack of material- but if we can make cheap replacement goods and encourage recycling, we can increase productivity and ease the burden.

SWE_ransonering코0=Rationing
SWE_ransonering_desc코0=There are some goods that are just too important to be misused. A patriotic spin on the concept of rationing will make the public happy with less.
SWE_air_defence코0=Luftvärnet
SWE_air_defence_desc코0=It would be a shame if our nation was destroyed from above, even more so if it was preventable. Construction of modern air defenses will keep Swedish airspace under Swedish control.
SWE_anschluss_finland코0=Arbetarbundet
SWE_hemvarnet코0=Home Guard
SWE_hemvarnet_desc코0=The Hemvärnet, or Home Guard, acts as a basic militia, keeping order in the streets and other basic jobs. With some training, though, we could easily use them as garrison troops in our regular military.

SWE_claim_aland코0=Revoke the Åland Convention

SWE_black_chamber코0=White Guard Uprising
SWE_black_chamber_desc코0=Explanantion:Sweden will incite a civil war in Finland and then be asked to join by Dem. Finland. Åland will some days after rise up and unit with sweden if u say yes. You will fight communist finland if you say yes.

###########Events
sweden.1.t코0=Sweden Demands Åland
sweden.1.d코0=Yesterday, the Swedish Government, having already restored their claim on Åland, made the next logical move- they demanded it outright. Representatives from Stockholm have a point when they say the islands are Swedish majority anyway, but our presence in the Baltic Sea would be vastly diminished. Still, the implication is that the alternative is war- and can we survive invasion?
sweden.1.a코0=Accept the Demands.
sweden.1.b코0=Åland is rightfully ours!

sweden.2.t코0=Finland Accepts Demands!
sweden.2.d코0=Today, for the first time since 1809, the Swedish flag has replaced the Finnish banners flying in Åland. While the populace was mostly apathetic, the Swedish government itself, having scored a diplomatic victory and the most important Naval base in the Gulf of Bothnia, was overjoyed. Conversely, the mood in Finland was somber, and it's particularly notable that despite giving the islands up, Finland still retains a claim on them.
sweden.2.a코0=Finally!

sweden.3.t코0=The Finns Refuse!
sweden.3.d코0=The Finns have made the questionable decision that a small island chain is worth risking the lives of their people. Perhaps they have a desire to once again be part of our nation- whatever their train of thought may be, war seems inevitable.
sweden.3.a코0=Outrageous!

sweden.6.t코0=Invitation to Swedish Faction
sweden.6.d코0=Sweden has been publicly supporting the idea of a Scandinavian alliance on the diplomatic scene in the last few weeks, and their ambassador to our nation has just informed us that they are intending to turn the concept into a reality. While few welcome the idea of being dragged into a far off war, the alliance- at the surface level, at least- seems purely defensive. What shall our response be?
sweden.6.a코0=Accept Alliance
sweden.6.b코0=Refuse Request

sweden.7.t코0=Finland Joins Alliance
sweden.7.d코0=Finland, unsurprisingly given its global position, has joined our alliance. Hopefully, this will deter the Russians from attempting a reconquest..
sweden.7.a코0=How very satisfying

sweden.8.t코0=Finland Refuses
sweden.8.d코0=The Finns have decided either they've got an obligation to another alliance or they just simply hate us too much to even entertain the idea of mutual protection. Whatever the reasoning, they rejected our offer.
sweden.8.a코0=Unfortunate

sweden.9.t코0=Invitation to Swedish Faction
sweden.9.d코0=Sweden has been publicly supporting the idea of a Scandinavian alliance on the diplomatic scene in the last few weeks, and their ambassador to our nation has just informed us that they are intending to turn the concept into a reality. While few welcome the idea of being dragged into a far off war, the alliance- at the surface level, at least- seems purely defensive. What shall our response be?
sweden.9.a코0=Accept Alliance
sweden.9.b코0=Refuse Request

sweden.10.t코0=Denmark Joins Alliance
sweden.10.d코0=Once our eternal enemy, the Danes are now in full cooperation with us. This will ensure the Baltic Sea is safe and sound.
sweden.10.a코0=How very satisfying

sweden.11.t코0=Denmark Refuses
sweden.11.d코0=The Danes have longer memories than we thought. It seems our old rivalry was too much for them to consider our alliance proposal.
sweden.11.a코0=Unfortunate

sweden.12.t코0=Invitation to Swedish Faction
sweden.12.d코0=Sweden has been publicly supporting the idea of a Scandinavian alliance on the diplomatic scene in the last few weeks, and their ambassador to our nation has just informed us that they are intending to turn the concept into a reality. While few welcome the idea of being dragged into a far off war, the alliance- at the surface level, at least- seems purely defensive. What shall our response be?
sweden.12.a코0=Accept Alliance
sweden.12.b코0=Refuse Request

sweden.13.t코0=Norway Joins Alliance
sweden.13.d코0=Once again, unity between Norway and Sweden has been established, though this time on far more equal grounds. Norway is with us, and our militaries will benefit from mutual help defending our coastlines.
sweden.13.a코0=How very satisfying

sweden.14.t코0=Norway Refuses
sweden.14.d코0=The Norwegians were troubled by our alliance proposal from the very start, and seem to have the idea that the Alliance was the first step in a road back to being a part of the Swedish realm once again. How paranoid- that was just ONE possibility...
sweden.14.a코0=Unfortunate

sweden.19.t코0=Parliamentary Altercations
sweden.19.d코0=The Åland issue has had farther reaching consequences than we've imagined. The Fascist and Communist elements alike are taking credit for the idea and saying that it supports their cause, and members of parliament formerly on the fringe of party lines have been abandoning the SAP and other Democratic parties to back their sides. If the SAP doesn't take decisive action now, the political landscape may change forever.
sweden.19.a코0=Accommodate the Right
sweden.19.b코0=Accommodate the Left
sweden.19.c코0=Show Strength!

sweden.20.t코0=Norway Refuses Our Demands!
sweden.20.d코0=The Norwegians have refused to become our puppet. Not actually the worst possible outcome- it means now we're just going to invade them and simply conquer them outright. Their stubborn nature will get them nowhere when Swedish rifles start blazing.
sweden.20.a코0=All for Nordic security.

norway.21.t코0=Unions push for Collective representation
norway.21.d코0=The Socialist elements in our country have been receiving support from international Communist organizations, and are beginning to make demands of the government. The Unions, who are supporting Communism more by the day, are backing them, meaning that if we don't go along, we may see more of those horrible strikes we've been enduring for so long. The demands are simple- either make parliamentary concessions or appoint Henry Wilhelm Kristiansen, one of their top men, to our cabinet. Is it worth the risk?
norway.21.a코0=Make Parliamentary Concessions
norway.21.b코0=Accept Henry Wilhelm Kristiansen
norway.21.c코0=Let them Strike!

norway.20.t코0=Fate of Norway
norway.20.d코0=The Swedish Foreign Minister recently made a public announcement- the Norwegian Government is not fulfilling its natural duty to protect its interests and keep order within its borders. They say that the only way to prevent foreign invasion is to take control of the military- and government- themselves. They have issued an identical ultimatum to us and have given us 24 hours to reply. Can we fight them off, or must we give up our independence again?
norway.20.a코0=Become a Swedish Puppet.
norway.20.b코0=Toss the envelope in the garbage!

sweden.22.t코0=The Finns Refuse our Union
sweden.22.d코0=The Finns have decided to continue to torture their workers and spit in the face of Human decency by declining our proposal of a Union. It seems petty issues like independence and sovereignty have corrupted their mindset.
sweden.22.a코0=How very sad

sweden.25.t코0=Malmö Communiqué

sweden.50.t코0=Baltic Mutiny

sweden.51.t코0=Soviet Vessels Captured!
sweden.51.d코0=Estonian freedom fighters in Tallinn have enacted a daring operation, capturing from the Soviets one Light Cruiser, two Destroyers and one Submarine in a stealthy maneuver. The partisans hijacked the ships while they were refueling on their way to Leningrad, and now have sailed them to Gotland and handed them over to us. This is great news!
sweden.51.a코0=Impressive!


sweden.55.t코0=Sweden asks to join the Allies
sweden.55.d코0=The Swedes have come to us requesting to join the Allies, seeing the fight for freedom worldwide as more important than avoiding their own conflict. Their navy could be useful and they make impressive weapons, but their military IS rather small. Accepting would be a commitment to securing Scandinavia, lest they simply join us and fall under occupation.
sweden.55.a코0=They are welcome!
sweden.55.b코0=They're probably spies for Jerry!

sweden.56.t코0=Brtiain refuses
sweden.56.d코0=The British have decided they can win the war without us. Overconfident as usual. There was no reason explicitly stated, so we can only guess at the reason for our exclusion. \n\n But they're probably just jealous of our super neat Destroyers.
sweden.56.a코0=Very unfortunate!

sweden.57.t코0=Britain accepts
sweden.57.d코0=The United Kingdom has accepted our proposal! Sweden now fights for freedom alongside the Allies!
sweden.57.a코0=Most satisfactory

sweden.60.t코0=Sweden proposes a Socialist Union
sweden.60.d코0=Internationalist Communists in our parliament have submitted a proposal to restore the Union with Sweden, allegedly for the glory of the Communist way- though even our most basic intel suggests the Swedes are backing them. It's unlikely we can take them on alone, given their almost guaranteed support from the Russians...do we fight for one last shot at freedom?
sweden.60.a코0=We have no choice.
sweden.60.b코0=Norway Forever!

sweden.61.t코0=The Norwegians Refuse
sweden.61.d코0=The Norwegians have refused our union. We should have made it a lot more clear that they didn't have a choice to begin with.
sweden.61.a코0=We demanded, not asked!


sweden.65.t코0=A Deal with Sweden
sweden.65.d코0=The Swedes have requested our support for their fledgling new Communist government- they're trying to establish a union in Norway. The upside is, they promise to support our claims on Karelia. We don't NEED Swedish support, but it would sure be nice for at least a bit of international recognition.
sweden.65.a코0=Accept the offer
sweden.65.b코0=Refuse the offer

sweden.66.t코0=The Soviets refuse our Offer!
sweden.66.d코0=The Soviets have declined our proposed deal. This is a tragic blow to Communist interests in Scandinavia.
sweden.66.a코0=False Communists!

sweden.67.t코0=The Soviets accept our Offer!
sweden.67.d코0=The wise leaders of the USSR have accepted our offer and are proud to stand alongside us in the struggle against Capitalism.
sweden.67.a코0=Great news!

sweden.70.t코0=The King Summons the Government
sweden.70.d코0=Gustaf V has called a meeting with several top political figures of Sweden, particularly those of the NSAP. He's been concerned lately about the NSAP's authoritarian views, and while opposed to Communism, doesn't see it as a particularly potent threat as the NSAP does. If the King could be convinced of the threat the Bolsheviks pose, it would be quite the boon for the NSAP's popularity among the people...
sweden.70.a코0=Show him the evils of Communism.
sweden.70.b코0=His opinion doesn't matter.

sweden.72.t코0=Royalist Newspapers
sweden.72.d코0=It seems King Gustaf has not taken this exile thing with the good humor we had hoped he would. He has joined with a group of dissidents to publish slander about our government! That old fool is just jealous HE doesn't get a seat of power anymore.
sweden.72.a코0=Seize and burn the publications!
sweden.72.b코0=It's not worth the effort.

sweden.75.t코0=Unite with Finland-Swedes
sweden.75.d코0=Some of our newly acquired lands in Finland are majority Swedish, and would comfortably be ruled under Sweden proper rather than as a part of Finland. Of course, setting this up would mean a weaker Finnish puppet state if we choose to create one...
sweden.75.a코0=Swedes under Sweden.
sweden.75.b코0=This is not worth the risk.

sweden.90.t코0=The Regal Cabinet
sweden.90.d코0=The King has defied Per Albin Hansson's long-standing policy of avoiding any foreign alliance by establishing a pact with Finland, which has opened up a divide between the two former amicable rulers. The King is within full legal right to dismiss and replace him, though this would surely displease the Republican elements of our population. Should Gustaf V carry this plan out?
sweden.90.a코0=Let the King form his Council.
sweden.90.b코0=Only if he wins the election.

sweden.100.t코0=The Stockholm Communiqué
sweden.100.d코0=Swedish King Gustaf V has invited the leaders of Norway and Denmark to a conference to discuss our relations, Europe's future, and where our nations would stand in the case of war. Attending would draw us all closer together, but is such a thing truly what we want?
sweden.100.a코0=Attend the Conference
sweden.100.b코0=No, this is not in our intrest

sweden.105.t코0=Operation Stella Polaris
sweden.105.d코0=The Soviets are dominating our poor nation so far, which is putting us at excessive risk of losing sensitive information- and we'd risk quite a bit if we let any of these important documents fall into Papa Joe's clutches. Our agents suggest we move operations to Sweden, a safer base that's far more removed from conflict, though we will lose some efficiency if we choose to do this.
sweden.105.a코0=Send them to Sweden
sweden.105.b코0=They are needed here!

sweden.106.t코0=Operation Stella Polaris
sweden.106.d코0=An unidentified man in a black trenchcoat met up with our head of government today at the Finnish ministry after dark, and explained in a deep, artificial sounding voice that Finland's war with the Soviets going so badly is putting sensitive information at risk. His proposal is to harbor the information here in Sweden instead- with the payment being the right to see some of the information ourselves, on top of the increased relations. The Russians would never approve of such a thing, however.
sweden.106.a코0=Perform the Operation
sweden.106.b코0=No, this is too risky

denmark.1.t코0=Dominium Maris Baltici

finland.40.t코0=Ask for Swedish help?
finland.40.d코0=As our country has devolved into Civil War against a power obviously being supported by the Soviet Union, we've been forced to look for allies ourselves. Sweden is an obvious sponsor- if we are able to secure their assistance, it would be a major boon to our side. Of course, the status of Åland is still in question, and while regrettable, it has been determined to be fair compensation...
finland.40.a코0=Ask Sweden to join
finland.40.b코0=No, this is our War!

finland.41.t코0=Finland calls for help
finland.41.d코0=The White Guard of Finland is asking for our help against the Communists attempting to take control of their nation. They have also promised us Åland as compensation for our help- quite a valuable trade! Are Swedish lives worth wasting in a foreign war, however?
finland.41.a코0=Join the Civil-War
finland.41.b코0=We cannot join

sweden.43.t코0=Åland Rises Up!
sweden.43.d코0=Patriotic citizens of Åland have joined the fight against the Communist threat and are eagerly marching towards the front lines now...as part of the Swedish army. Still, this is a good alternative to Red rule.
sweden.43.a코0=Fortunate!

finland.45.t코0=Sweden Refuses to join
finland.45.d코0=The Swedes have do not have the necessary desire to join our war, this is very unfortunate!
finland.45.a코0=Betrayal!

import.10.t코0=Sweden asks for help
import.10.d코0=The Swedes are currently fighting for a free Scandinavia and the power balance is not to their advantage. The Region is strategically very important in the European Theatre and we cannot let the totalitarian Regimes gain control. The Swedes ask us to send 2000 Infantry Equipment, 500 Support Equipment and 200 Artillery Pieces together with 8000 Volunteers from the US. Should we accept their Request?
import.10.a코0=Yes, send it!
import.10.b코0=No, we cannot spare anything.

import.11.t코0=The US sends help
import.11.d코0=Our pleas have been heard and the US is sending us equipment and Volunteers to fight on our behalf. This is a very fortunate turn of events, we must use them as best we can. The cargo can be expected to arrive in about 20 days.
import.11.a코0=This might save us!

import.12.t코0=US equipment arrives
import.12.d코0=The long sought after Volunteers and equipment have finally arrived in Sweden. Now we must put them to good use!
import.12.a코0=Finally!

import.13.t코0=The US refuses
import.13.d코0=The US cannot or will not send any equipment or Volunteers to us. This is a disaster! We needed it badly.
import.13.a코0=A Disaster

exileunits.2.t코0=Polistrupper Recruited & Trained
exileunits.2.d코0=The Polistrupper from Denmark and Norway are trained and ready for battle. As they prepare to one day return to their own homelands, in the meantime, they'll be fighting alongside our military.
exileunits.2.a코0=A fine addition

iceland.1.t코0=Icelandic Mutiny
iceland.1.d코0=A fascist mutiny has occured! After minor inspections, it's pretty obvious that they are supplied. While the entire country is in riots, what stance do we take? Do we silence it or not? Since silencing it might lead to it's supplier to take it's own action. The two most likely suppliers at this point are Germany or Sweden.
iceland.1.a코0=Silence the uprising!
iceland.1.b코0=We have no choice but to surrender.

iceland.11.t코0=Iceland Silences the Uprising!
iceland.11.d코0=It seems like our planned uprising in Iceland didn't quite go as we expected. It seems that the government has been able to silence it with their limited resources. The question is: What do we do now? We could launch a full military invasion ourselves but then we'd also have to deal with Denmark and most likely Greenland.
iceland.11.a코0=Invasion it is!
iceland.11.b코0=We'll back off for now.

iceland.2.t코0=Icelandic Declares Independence!
iceland.2.d코0=In a shocking turn of events, the small Danish military presence on Iceland has been kicked off by a small, but well armed group of Nationalists. Danish rule is being threatened- we must restore order! Unless we can't spare the manpower, or perhaps if we had some moral objections...
iceland.2.a코0=Give them Sovereignty
iceland.2.b코0=Declare War and take back Iceland!

iceland.3.t코0=Denmark Declares War on us
iceland.3.d코0=The Danish government has declared our independence attempt unlawful and is sending an invasion to our shores to try and stop the fun. Sweden has promised us support, but it would be far more impressive, yet difficult, to win on our own...
iceland.3.a코0=Fight on our Own!
iceland.3.b코0=Ask the Swedes for help

iceland.4.t코0=Iceland asks for help
iceland.4.d코0=Just as we predicted, Iceland has asked us for support against the Danes- a perfect opportunity to strike Denmark down, frankly! We could also leave them to waste their time invading Iceland, but it would be unlikely we'd get another opportunity like this any time soon...
iceland.4.a코0=They are on their own
iceland.4.b코0=Fight for Iceland!

iceland.5.t코0=The Swedes Intervene
iceland.5.d코0=The Swedes have decided to fight along side us and hope to defeat the Danes on our behalf. Our efforts have not been in vain, it was well worth it.
iceland.5.a코0=Glory and sovereignty is near!

iceland.7.t코0=Denmark backs down
iceland.7.d코0=Denmark has accepted Iceland's independence, claiming simply that if it's what the Icelandic people desire, the Danes will not stop them. Almost everyone in Europe is speculating the true reason, but whatever it may be, Iceland is independent without even so much as a casualty.
iceland.7.a코0=Unexpected

iceland.10.t코0=Arm the Fjölnismenn
iceland.10.d코0=We have successfully transported arms and officers to the Icelandic Nationalists. The Fjölnismenn as they call themselves, have been keen to receive our support and are now preparing to conduct a rebellion. Are we willing to see it through?
iceland.10.a코0=Oh, we will!


news.900.t코0=Sweden Puppets Norway
news.900.d코0=Citing a change in the political climate of Europe since their 1905 split, Sweden has rendered Norway nothing more than a puppet state, nominally due to the Norwegian military's inability to control the Scandinavian coastline. Many Norwegians, particularly those old enough to remember the union with Sweden, are protesting the decision, but so far no organized resistance has been mounted. Norway is, once again, Swedish territory.
news.900.a코0=Troublesome

news.902.t코0=The Baltic States Rise Up!
news.902.d코0=It seems the Soviet control of the Baltic states is not as solid as it would look from the outside. At midnight last night, pro-independence groups through all of the Baltic states launched a full-scale rebellion against their Soviet overlords. While Lithuania's uprising was controlled by local occupation forces, Estonia and Latvia are still under rebel control as of press time. \n\n While foreign intervention is suspected, no decisive evidence has implicated any nation yet.
news.902.a코0=Inspiring!

news.903.t코0=The Baltic States Rise Up!
news.903.d코0=It seems the Soviet control of the Baltic states is not as solid as it would look from the outside. At midnight last night, pro-independence groups through all of the Baltic states launched a full-scale rebellion against their Soviet overlords. While Latvia and Lithuania's uprisings were controlled by local occupation forces, Estonia is still under rebel control as of press time. \n\n During the pacification of Latvia, two men identified as Swedish nationals were arrested. The Soviets have yet to make an official response.
news.903.a코0=Sweden is playing with fire.

news.904.t코0=Second Finnish Civil-War
news.904.d코0=In rather predictable fashion, Civil War has embroiled once again between Communists and a coalition of Democrats, Fascists, and Monarchists in Finland. Despite broad civil support of the Coalition forces, the Soviet Union has already begun to blatantly sponsor the Communist state, and without foreign intervention, one must wonder how successful they will be in preventing what is in all practicality a coup.
news.904.a코0=What, again?

news.905.t코0=Sweden Joins Second Finnish Civil-War
news.905.d코0=In positive news for non-Communists, the Swedish military has declared full support of the Finnish Coalition forces within their Civil War. While Sweden is certainly no match for the Soviet Union, their support may go a long way to balancing the otherwise one-sided conflict, and the potential of more countries backing the Coalition has just increased that much more. \n\n Though Sweden declined it was receiving compensation for its efforts, a commercial vessel in the Baltic sea noted that Swedish infantry brigades were garrison on several islands of the Åland chain.
news.905.a코0=Curious turn of Events

news.906.t코0=Sweden revokes the Åland Convention!
news.906.d코0=The Åland Convention was signed in 1921, stating that the namesake islands were legally to be administrated by Finland, but as compensation, the area would not only be granted autonomy, it would also be entirely demilitarized. Seeing this as no longer in Sweden's favor, the largest Nordic nation has once again laid claim to the Islands. In response, Finland has remilitarized the archipelago, and diplomatic relations are starting to sharply decline between the two countries.
news.906.a코0=All this over a few islands.
news.906.b코0=Finally!

news.907.t코0=The King takes on Communists
news.907.d코0=King Gustaf is a vocal critic of Communism, and recently he's made a major speech denouncing the entire ideology and attempting to convince its supporters to instead support the more moderate Social Democrat party. Due to the King's personal sway with several Swedish civilians, many are abandoning the Hammer and Sickle in favor of a simple leftist Democratic party.
news.907.a코0=We must crush the Elites!

news.908.t코0=The King is Arrested!
news.908.d코0=The King Gustaf V has been captured and placed under house arrest in a shocking and bold move by the Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti. The King was on his way to Uppsala, when his motorcade was unexpectedly jumped by armed Partisans. The King's life has been spared in exchange for a guarantee that the monarchy would be abolished and his family would renounce all claims to any throne- but many Swedish citizens are wondering if the Communists will be true to their word.
news.908.a코0=Justice for all

news.909.t코0=The King is Exiled!
news.909.d코0=Revolutionaries from the SKP made a violent attack on the palace in Stockholm today in an attempt to capture, or perhaps kill, the Swedish king. The crowd was dismayed to find an empty palace- the King had already escaped under the cover of night, after hearing reports from his bodyguards of members of his kitchen staff openly supporting the move. Sightings of the King and his family are cropping up in several cities around Europe, and no matter where he makes his residence, one can expect him to continue his crusade against Communism.
news.909.a코0=The old man's harmless.

news.910.t코0=The Buckingham Gathering
news.910.d코0=Gustaf V, the former Swedish king, has made his first major public appearance since his self-imposed exile. After a meeting with the British royal family, the King gave a conference with various global journalist in front of the Palace, describing his situation and making more public jabs against Communism. The global community has generally taken his side, and the only response the sitting Swedish government could muster was calling him a bourgeois reactionary, which has impressed few- if any- foreign dignitaries.
news.910.a코0=The nerve!
news.910.b코0=Interesting

news.911.t코0=Sweden and Norway join in a Socialist Union
news.911.d코0=Sweden and Norway are unified once again under what politicians from the new nation have coined the ''Scandinavian Socialist Union''. Though the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Uruguay are the only nations to officially recognize the new Union, it is impossible to deny that this is a major shift in the balance of power in Scandinavia. If Democratic or Fascist forces want to make a foothold in the region, they now must face a quite powerful bulwark.
news.911.a코0=Unexpected
news.911.b코0=A great day!

news.912.t코0=Icelandic Independence
news.912.d코0=Though Iceland's population is small, and its thirst for independence is not significant, a small band of rebels, thought to be armed by an outside power, have risen up today and taken control of the entire island. There is no direct proof, at least any revealed so far, but international observers are speculating that the benefactors were either from the German or Swedish government. Denmark has yet to make a response, though an attempt to re-occupy the island is expected.
news.912.a코0=How will the Danes respond?
news.912.b코0=Good News!
news.912.c코0=Outrageous!
