ITA_renew_the_italo_yemeni_treaty_desc코0=The Italo-Yemeni Treaty, also known as the Treaty of San'a, was concluded in 1926. It recognized Imam Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din as King of Yemen, sealed the friendship between our two nations, and recognized Yemen's claims on Aden. With the annexation of Ethiopia and the extension of our influence in the Red Sea, we should renew this treaty.

# Events

r56_italy.1.t코0=The King Removes Mussolini from Power
r56_italy.1.d코0=Following an emergency meeting requested by King Victor Emmanuel III, the latter met with Mussolini, asking for his resignation, pointing in particular the enormous debt in which Italy finds itself and that the latter has not been able to resolve in almost fifteen years of power, the economic abyss that was the Ethiopian campaign, as well as the problems caused by the embargoes suffered following the invasion.\n\nUnder pressure from the Grand Council of Fascism, which began to turn against him, particularly under the influence of the royalists who tried to make a bigger place for themselves, Mussolini had no choice but to accept the order, not wishing to face prison. Pietro Badoglio was then appointed Prime Minister. The latter, despite his many links with the fascist administration, is seen as a much more moderate figure.\n\nIt is clear that the King is trying to save the face of Italy, whose situation is constantly falling apart.
r56_italy.1.a코0=Let's hope the situation can be fixed.

r56_italy.2.t코0=The Ethiopian Armistice
r56_italy.2.d코0=One of Badoglio's first objectives was to end the costly conflicts in Ethiopia. The new Foreign Minister, Alfredo Covelli, was sent to negotiate an end to hostilities between our two nations, and managed to negotiate peace, but forced us to pay some war reparations for the many civil destructions that took place during the conflict.
r56_italy.2.a코0=Better a few repairs for now than a permanent economic abyss.

r56_italy.3.t코0=The New Cabinet
r56_italy.3.d코0=A few days after his appointment as Prime Minister, Pietro Badoglio formed his new government. Even if Badoglio still claims to act on behalf of the Partito Nazional Fascista, the fascist influence has been reduced within the ministries, with the participation of many monarchists in the new cabinet, probably under the impulse of the king, concerned about the new problems that could arise from maintaining the economic and social policies of the fascists.
r56_italy.3.a코0=Out with the old and in with the new!

r56_italy.4.t코0=Giovanni Messe's Proposition
r56_italy.4.d코0=Giovanni Messe, Major General, former Commander of the Third Cavalry Division, and Minister of the Interior in the government of Pietro Badoglio, today approached the latter with a rather specific proposal. It was indeed clear to Messe that Badoglio's ultimate goal was the removal of the fascists from power.\n\nThe latter suggested using potential monarchists in Blackshirts and other organizations very close to the leaders of the Partito Nazional Fascista in order to eliminate the party's leading figures from within. Thus, once deprived of its leaders, the elimination of its last elements would be possible without having to shed too much blood.
r56_italy.4.a코0=By destroying the vital points, the movement will fall by itself.
r56_italy.4.b코0=What if it backfires? We do not need to resort to such dangerous methods!

r56_italy.5.t코0=Death of Arturo Bocchini
r56_italy.5.d코0=Arturo Bocchini, head of both the police but especially of the Organizzazione per la Vigilanza e la Repressione dell' Antifascismo, the secret police of the Partito Nazional Fascista, was found dead in his home, two bullets in the head.\n\nThe latter was chosen as the first target due to the fear that the OVRA would discover the government's plot. The position is now vacant, largely reducing any risk of being uncovered by the latter.
r56_italy.5.a코0=Excellent.

r56_italy.6.t코0=Fascists Blame the Communists for the Assassination
r56_italy.6.d코0=The murder of Arturo Bocchini shocked many executives of the Partito Nazional Fascista. In "Il Popolo d'Italia", the party's official newspaper, one could see \"The resurgent communist threat\" written in large letters, indeed blaming potential members of the Partito Comunista Italiano for the assassination.\n\nLuigi Russo, leader of the Blackshirts, called for increased vigilance by the latter against any element deemed \"anti-fascist\".
r56_italy.6.a코0=At least they're not suspecting us.

r56_italy.7.t코0=Murder of the Rosselli Brothers
r56_italy.7.d코0=Carlo Rosselli and Sabatino Rosselli, two exiled anti-fascist activists, who notably participated in the Spanish war alongside the Republicans, were murdered by the French organisation "La Cagoule", while they were in Bagnoles-de-l'Orne, Normandy, to be treated for the phlebitis they had caught during their fight in Spain.\n\nThey had notably founded the "Giustizia e Libertà" movement alongside other anti-Mussolini exiles, in particular republicans with ideas ranging from liberalism to socialism.
r56_italy.7.a코0=Two less problems.

r56_italy.8.t코0=Diplomatic Incident at the League of Nations
r56_italy.8.d코0=In a speech to the League of Nations by Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia, taking offence at the Italian invasion and asking for diplomatic help to put an end to the conflict, the Italian journalists present began to make fun of the Emperor.\n\nIn reaction to what he considered to be \"foolishness\", Nicolae Titulescu, a Romanian diplomat present at the time, replied by asking for the departure of these same journalists, going so far as to declare \"To the door the savages!\"
r56_italy.8.a코0=Who does he think he is?
ITA_diplomatic_incident_at_the_league_of_nations코0=Diplomatic Incident at the League of Nations

r56_italy.9.t코0=Militarization of the Rome Protocols
r56_italy.9.d코0=First signed in 1934 between the governments of Austria, Hungary and Italy, the Rome Protocols were agreements mainly dedicated to economic cooperation between the three nations and to opposing the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. Under Italy's leadership, a second version of these protocols was signed, including a military alliance between the three nations.\n\nMany see this as Italy's attempt to find a place in Europe after leaving the League of Nations, and to prevent Germany from integrating Austria into the Reich.
r56_italy.9.a코0=Perhaps this will guarantee the stability of Central Europe.

r56_italy.10.t코0=The Second Stresa Front
r56_italy.10.d코0=Faced with what they considered to be a "rising German threat", the Italian, French and British governments met again in the city of Stresa to announce the re-creation of the Front of the same name, which had been broken following the Italian invasion of the Abyssinia. In exchange, the French and British governments agreed to lift the embargoes on Italy.\n\nTheir aim is to maintain the territorial integrity of Austria against the German Reich, as well as to ensure that the latter respects the Treaty of Versailles. 
r56_italy.10.a코0=Radically different governments united in maintaining their previous victory.

r56_italy.11.t코0=The Pact of Steel
r56_italy.11.d코0=The various embargoes suffered by Italy following its invasion of Abyssinia led to its rapprochement with nations different from its regular allies, in particular Germany, with whom relations warmed up after Italy agreed to cease it guarantee of Austria, which Germany eventually wished to annex, despite the violation of the Treaty of Versailles\n\nFollowing the signature of the Pact of Friendship and Alliance between Germany and Italy, the latter have undertaken to support each other militarily in the coming years.
r56_italy.11.a코0=What will this mean for Europe?

r56_italy.12.t코0=Italy Wants to Reform the Stresa Front
r56_italy.12.d코0=Fearing that the Nazi government would seek to transgress the Treaty of Versailles, particularly through its revenge rhetoric, Italy called on us to reform the Stresa front, in particular by ensuring that no unprovoked aggression such as the one that took place in Abyssinia would be repeated.\n\nWe would undertake to guarantee Austria's territorial integrity and the terms of the Versailles Treaty, which could lead to a military response if necessary.
r56_italy.12.a코0=The Versailles Treaty must be defended at all costs!
r56_italy.12.b코0=We cannot trust Italy anymore...

r56_italy.13.t코0=Italy Wants to Reform the Stresa Front
r56_italy.13.d코0=Fearing that the Nazi government would seek to transgress the Treaty of Versailles, particularly through its revenge rhetoric, Italy called on us to reform the Stresa front, in particular by ensuring that no unprovoked aggression such as the one that took place in Abyssinia would be repeated. We would undertake to guarantee Austria's territorial integrity and the terms of the Versailles Treaty, which could lead to a military response if necessary.
r56_italy.13.a코0=It would be prudent to accept.
r56_italy.13.b코0=Italy has already crossed the line once, what guarantees us it won't do it again?

r56_italy.14.t코0=Reformation of the Stresa Front
r56_italy.14.d코0=France and Great Britain have both agreed to reform our common front against Germany.\n\nLet us hope that this will make it possible to safeguard what we fought for during the Great War and also to guarantee peace in Europe.
r56_italy.14.a코0=The Entente is Reborn!

r56_italy.15.t코0=Italy Wants to Militarize the Rome Protocols
r56_italy.15.d코0=Citing in particular the growing revanchism in Germany, which could threaten the interests of our three countries Austria, Hungary and Italy, the latter suggested extending the Rome Protocols to include a defensive and offensive military alliance.\n\nAccording to them, the creation of a new bloc in central and southern Europe would make it possible to avoid any suppression of belligerent powers.
r56_italy.15.a코0=It would be prudent to accept.
r56_italy.15.b코0=This might end up causing an even bigger war, we shall refuse!

r56_italy.16.t코0=Italian Ultimatum
r56_italy.16.d코0=Declaring Romania a strategic region for the Rome Pact, particularly for Italy and Hungary, the Italian ambassador issued an ultimatum to the Romanian government.\n\They demand that the entirety of Transylvania be returned to Hungary, that Italian interests in the oil fields be guaranteed, and that the Italian government have a right of scrutiny over government decisions, including by giving the ambassador a veto.\n\nThe latter made it clear that any refusal could lead to military misconduct.
r56_italy.16.a코0=We have no choice but to accept...
r56_italy.16.b코0=We will not give away our independence so easily!

r56_italy.17.t코0=Romania Refuse the Ultimatum!
r56_italy.17.d코0=Describing the Italian demands as "absurd", the Romanian government refused the ultimatum sent a few days ago, and refuses any renegotiation of it. We threatened military reprisals if we refused.\n\nThe question is whether we should carry out these threats or postpone them.
r56_italy.17.a코0=They chose their fate.
r56_italy.17.b코0=We cannot afford a war at the moment.

r56_italy.18.t코0=Italy Suggests Closer Military Cooperation
r56_italy.18.d코0=In recent months, our relations with Italy have warmed up, as the latter has been diplomatically and economically abandoned by its former allies, nominally the former powers of the Entente.\nWe were approached by the Italian ambassador with a proposal to sign a military alliance between our two nations, intended in particular for assistance in a hypothetical war with Great Britain, France or the Soviet Union.\n\nA rapprochement with Italy would certainly enable us to secure the southern Alps, a very difficult terrain, and would ensure us some control in the Mediterranean and Africa, two areas that we were no longer able to control.\n\nHowever, we should not forget the first betrayal we suffered at the beginning of the Great War and our various conflicts with our zones of influence, the latter overlapping in many areas.
r56_italy.18.a코0=The Rome-Berlin Axis shall never be defeated!
r56_italy.18.b코0=Where would this lead except to another backstab?

r56_italy.19.t코0=Germany Accepts the Pact
r56_italy.19.d코0=The German government has responded positively to our proposal for a military alliance, officially sealing friendship and cooperation between our two nations, proving that we have no need to comply with the demands of the Entente democracies.
r56_italy.19.a코0=A New Axis is Born!

r56_italy.20.t코0=Germany Refuses the Pact!
r56_italy.20.d코0=Declaring that cooperation between our two nations would not be beneficial to Germany, the latter declined our proposal for a military alliance between our two nations.
r56_italy.20.a코0=Once again, we have been abandoned!

r56_italy.21.t코0=Italy Demands Control over Internal Politics
r56_italy.21.d코0=The Italian ambassador gave us a request directly from Rome. The Italian Government demands a right of scrutiny and veto over Albania's internal and external policy, stating that it wants to defend "the interests of the Italian nation within Albania".\n\nIt was specified that a refusal of the request could be accompanied by severe economic sanctions or even military action in the event of what they consider to be a "serious attack on the many Italian efforts that have been made in Albania".\n\nIt is clear that accepting these requests would mean a significant loss of Albanian independence.
r56_italy.21.a코0=We fear no army, let them come!
r56_italy.21.b코0=We have no choice but to accept...

r56_italy.22.t코0=Albania Refuses the Ultimatum
r56_italy.22.d코0=Describing our demands as a "real insult to the Albanian nation and its people", the Albanian government refused our demands for stricter control over their policies. What should we do in retaliation?
r56_italy.22.a코0=They knew the consequences, invade them!
r56_italy.22.b코0=We do not have the time for a war with Albania.

r56_italy.23.t코0=Italy Demands Dalmatia
r56_italy.23.d코0=Citing the historical Italian population in the Dalmatian region, the Italian government sent us a request for the return of the entire province of Dalmatia to Italy, with evacuation of [Root.GetAdjective] troops within 72 hours of the transfer of territory. The latter threatened military reprisals in the event of refusal.
r56_italy.23.a코0=If this prevents a war, so be it.
r56_italy.23.b코0=Dalmatia is rightfully ours!

r56_italy.24.t코0=[103.Owner.GetName] Refuses to Abandon Dalmatia!
r56_italy.24.d코0=The [103.Owner.GetAdjective] government has told us that it will not "bend its knee in the face of a government that does not wish to respect the people living in Dalmatia", and there is an apparent increase in military presence in the region and along their border with us. What should we do?
r56_italy.24.a코0=They should have given it peacefully. We shall be reunited by force!
r56_italy.24.b코0=We will come back later!

r56_italy.25.t코0=The Stresa Front's Guarantee on Austria
r56_italy.25.d코0=Declaring this to be the "priority of the Stresa Front", the Italian government suggested signing an official declaration of protection by Austria, allowing it to count on us in the event of a conflict, particularly with Germany.
r56_italy.25.a코0=Austria has our protection.
r56_italy.25.b코0=We have no interests in defending Austria.

r56_italy.26.t코0=Italy Seizes the Balearic Islands
r56_italy.26.d코0=Declaring that it wanted to "safeguard Italian interests in the Mediterranean and above all to protect these islands", the Italian government decided to seize the Balares Islands, sending several garrisons of troops to establish its presence there.
r56_italy.26.a코0=We never allowed that!

r56_italy.27.t코0=Italy Occupies the Balearic Islands for Us
r56_italy.27.d코0=The Italian government has decided to send a garrison to the whale islands in order to prevent the Republican government from gaining access to them. The latter have told us that they are only protecting our interests by avoiding a suppremacy in the Mediterranean for the Republicans.
r56_italy.27.a코0=Let's hope they will give them back...


r56_italy.28.t코0=The Stresa Front Refused
r56_italy.28.d코0=The government of [From.GetNameDefCap] has decided to reject our proposal to reform the Stresa front. Thus, we will have to continue without their help.
r56_italy.28.a코0=Our road will be without them.

r56_italy.29.t코0=The Regia Marina's Budget Question
r56_italy.29.d코0=Since the end of the Great War, the Italian government has set itself the objective of dominating the Mediterranean and, to achieve this, has launched major projects to modernise the navy. However, these projects have a cost, and thus part of the budget normally allocated to the army was redirected to the Regia Marina, creating an imbalance in the production of equipment.\n\nWe could try to adjust the budget to return to something equal for all three branches, but perhaps the key to victory lies in the domination of the seas?
r56_italy.29.a코0=We must return to a balanced budget!
r56_italy.29.b코0=The budget is fine as it is.
r56_italy.29.c코0=More funding for the Regia Marina!

r56_italy.30.t코0=Event to Decide if Italo Balbo Dies
r56_italy.30.d코0=You are not meant to see it. If you do, please report!
r56_italy.30.a코0=Okay. Will do!

r56_italy.31.t코0=Italo Balbo Killed in an Accident
r56_italy.31.d코0=While he was a passenger on a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 scheduled to land in Tobruk, Libya, his plane was mistaken for an enemy fighter, and was shot down by anti-aircraft batteries supposed to defend the airstrip.\n\nA hero of Italian aviation and one of the main organizers of the Partito Nazional Fascista and the March on Rome, he was one of the main popularizers of aviation in Italy.
r56_italy.31.a코0=Today we lost more than an aviator, we lost a legend.

r56_italy.32.t코0=Greece Protects Albania
r56_italy.32.d코0=Greece has occupied Albania, our future landing point in the balkans, how should we respond
r56_italy.32.a코0=Early war!
r56_italy.32.b코0=Don't strike yet.

r56_italy.100.t코0=The Formalisation of the Stresa Front
r56_italy.100.d코0=Diplomats from Italy, France and the United Kingdom have reconvened in Stresa, Switzerland for the final round of talks on the Stresa Front against Germany. The proposal on the table is to formalise the front as a military alliance against German aggression and influence in Europe. While relations between the democratic powers and Italy's Fascist government have been rocky in the last few years, the recent talks have been positive. While France looks set to join, there are worries that this power block will weaken Britain's diplomatic independence.
r56_italy.100.a코0=Together we will stand against Germany.
r56_italy.100.b코0=We are okay with the current agreement.

r56_italy.101.t코0=The Allies Join the Stresa Front
r56_italy.101.d코0=The representatives of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth have agreed to formalise the Stresa Front.
r56_italy.101.a코0=Excellent.

r56_italy.102.t코0=The Allies Refuse to Join the Stresa Front
r56_italy.102.d코0=The representatives of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth have declined our offer to formalise the Stresa Front.
r56_italy.102.a코0=Unfortunate.

r56_italy.103.t코0=The Formalisation of the Stresa Front
r56_italy.103.d코0=Diplomats from Italy, France and the United Kingdom have reconvened in Stresa, Switzerland for the final round of talks on the Stresa Front, aimed at countering growing German aggression and influence in Europe. While relations between the democratic powers and Italy's Fascist government have been rocky in the last few years, the recent proved positive with a joint declaration formalising a military alliance between all signatories of the Stresa Front.
r56_italy.103.a코0=Together for victory!
r56_italy.103.b코0=They bound together like sheep scared of a wolf.
r56_italy.103.c코0=Let's hope they can work together for good.

ITA_lack_of_powered_planes_desc코0=One of the main weaknesses of the Italian Air Force is the lack of horsepower in the aircraft produced, leaving a stain on the rest of the plane's equipment.\nA major modernisation of our engine production capacities is necessary to solve this problem, which makes our aircraft less efficient in terms of speed, something very damaging in an era where aircraft are only going faster every year.

ITA_ultimatum_to_albania코0=Ultimatum to Albania
ITA_ultimatum_to_albania_desc코0=For many years we have had views on Albania, having already transformed it into a de facto protectorate. It is now time to fully integrate it into our empire by requesting the deposition of the current government.
ITA_alliance_with_austria코0=Alliance with Austria
ITA_alliance_with_austria_desc코0=The best way to deter Germany from invading Austria would be to sign an alliance treaty with Austria, thus guaranteeing its borders from any aggression.
ITA_claims_on_yugoslavia코0=Claims on Yugoslavia
ITA_claims_on_yugoslavia_desc코0=It is time for us to redress one of the greatest injustices inflicted on Italy, namely our separation from Dalmatia when the Italian populations of this region go back several centuries.
ITA_the_new_spain코0=The New Spain
ITA_the_new_spain_desc코0=The victory of the nationalist forces in the Spanish civil war has brought our two countries closer together, which are now not only culturally united, but also politically united.

ITA_formalize_the_albanian_protectorate코0=Formalize the Albanian Protectorate

ITA_demand_dalmatia코0=Demand Dalmatia
ITA_demand_dalmatia_desc코0=One issue has still not been resolved, namely that of Dalmatia, which was promised to Italy at the end of the Great War. With the support of our allies, we should easily convince Yugoslavia to hand over this province to us.

ITA_resume_food_importation코0=Resume Food Importation
ITA_resume_food_importation_desc코0=Following the Great Depression, we made efforts to reduce our imports, especially of wheat, preferring to try to produce it ourselves. This came at the expense of vegetable and fruit production, and did not improve the situation of the farmers. Now that our embargoes have been lifted, we should try to return to our previous production situation by resuming our imports of Canadian and American wheat.
ITA_decrease_tariffs코0=Decrease Tariffs
ITA_decrease_tariffs_desc코0=To stimulate the economy, we could try to lower the tariffs we had implemented following the Great Depression, making us more commercially attractive. After all, Italy has always been known for its trade.

ITA_operazione_dacia코0=Operazione Dacia
ITA_operazione_dacia_desc코0=Romania's strategic position and oil resources mean that we cannot afford to see it pass into the sphere of one of our enemies.

ITA_end_yugoslavia코0=End Yugoslavia
ITA_partition_yugoslavia코0=Partition Yugoslavia

ITA_complete_the_latin_alliance코0=Complete the Latin Alliance
ITA_complete_the_latin_alliance_desc코0=With the addition of Romania and Spain to our alliance, it is now time to extend the alliance of Latin nations by inviting Portugal to join us, thus offering us an optimal position to dominate the Atlantic and Africa.

ITA_italianize_dalmatia코0=Italianize Dalmatia

ITA_operazione_cesare코0=Operazione Cesare
ITA_operazione_cesare_desc코0=Since France took our beloved Corsican, the Italians in France have been suffering constantly, particularly through programmes designed to make the population more French-speaking. It is time for us to be reunited with our brothers.

ITA_operazione_costantino코0=Operazione Costantino
ITA_operazione_costantino_desc코0=No one has frightened the world as much as the Bolshevik terror lurking in its cold high repair in Russia. It is time to put an end to the communist threat and thus ensure Italian hegemony throughout Europe.

ITA_expand_the_comando_supremo코0=Expand the Comando Supremo's Role
ITA_expand_the_comando_supremo_desc코0=The high command has a very minor role in relation to army decisions, especially in informing individual commanders of the government's expectations. We should seek to expand both its importance and its membership.

ITA_the_new_arditi코0=The New Arditi
ITA_the_new_arditi_desc코0=The "Reparti d'Assalto", also known as "Arditi", was a special corps of the Italian army during the First World War. They were the first modern shock troops and were feared by all central powers. With many of its members having become important figures in the Italian army, it would be interesting to reform a modern equivalent.
ITA_carro_armato코0=Carro Armato P 40
ITA_carro_armato_desc코0=Our motorization of the army must also be accompanied by a more extensive use of tanks. Most of the ones we use date from the Great War, so we should try to keep them up to date.

ITA_end_the_army_corruption코0=End the Army's Corruption
ITA_end_the_army_corruption_desc코0=Our policy of favouritism towards party members has given us a loyal army, but at the same time it has found itself corrupted and led by people who favour increasing their influence within the latter rather than its modernisation.

ITA_end_the_army_corruption_tt코0=Some generals will be §Ydismissed§!
ITA_the_backbone_of_the_party코0=The Backbone of the Party

ITA_adapt_great_war_tactics코0=Adapt Great War Tactics
ITA_adapt_great_war_tactics_desc코0=The High Command remains convinced that we can reuse the same tactics that led us to victory in the Great War. We cannot change their minds completely, but we can try to adapt them sufficiently.
ITA_reshuffle_the_officer_corps코0=Reshuffle the Officer Corps
ITA_reshuffle_the_officer_corps_desc코0=The various rivalries within the high command have led officers to be promoted solely through their affiliation and loyalty to one of the army leaders. Inspections and changes, if necessary, of these officers must be carried out.

ITA_pride_of_the_nation코0=Pride of the Nation

ITA_question_the_high_command코0=Question the High Command
ITA_question_the_high_command_desc코0=The High Command is largely composed of old veterans of the First World War, who have known only colonial clashes for other conflicts. Without necessarily dismissing them, we should give more weight to younger officers.

ITA_war_without_bloodshed코0=War without Bloodshed
ITA_war_without_bloodshed_desc코0=Using violence would certainly solve the problem faster, but it could backfire very severely, and at such a crucial time, we cannot afford it. Using a political strategy that gradually lost its influence to the fascists would allow a smooth transition.
ITA_war_without_bloodshed_tt코0=The §GFascists§! will take much longer to weaken, But Will Cement §gMonarchists§!
ITA_meet_with_messe코0=Meet with Messe
ITA_meet_with_messe_desc코0=Because of the glory enjoyed by Giovanni Messe, our Minister of the Interior and fervent royalist, the latter is highly respected but above all has a certain influence. We could use potential royalists infiltrated into fascist institutions to destroy them from within.
ITA_meet_with_messe_tt코0=The §Gfascists§! will be much weaker, but this will not necessarily benefit the §gmonarchists§!, and could backfire.
ITA_victory_in_the_civil_war코0=Victory in the Civil War

ITA_expand_the_iri_role_desc코0=Founded with the aim of saving, restructuring and financing the banks and companies that went bankrupt during the Great Depression, the latter found itself in the possession of many Italian banks.

ITA_po_valley_mettalurgy코0=Po Valley's Metallurgy
ITA_po_valley_mettalurgy_desc코0=The Po plain is home to a large part of Italian industry, and in particular metalworking, particularly in Turin and Genoa. This industry is vital and should be supported as a priority.

ITA_bring_industry_to_the_mezzogiorno_desc코0=The Mezzogiorno, the southern region of Italy, has always been behind in terms of industrialization, most of its inhabitants being farmers. It is time to bring the south to a level equal to the north in terms of industry.
ITA_expand_libyan_oil_production코0=Petrolibya Society
ITA_expand_libyan_oil_production_desc코0=Under its great desert, Libya hides large reserves of oil still untouched. Due to the strong colonization already undertaken, resulting in a considerable Italian presence, it would not be difficult to expand our petroleum extraction capacities.
ITA_increase_settlements_in_eritrea코0=Increase Settlements in Eritrea
ITA_increase_settlements_in_eritrea_desc코0=Eritrea is full of opportunities due to its climate favourable to livestock farming and its basements filled with mineral mills ranging from iron to gold.

ITA_compagnia_etiopica_degli_esplosivi_desc코0=To support not only the troops defending East Africa, but also our entire army, the expansion of our explosive production capabilities is necessary. Ethiopia, whose road modernization has boosted its economic development, would be perfect for this.

ITA_cementerie_d_etiopia_desc코0=The development of the cement industry would increase our construction capacity in Ethiopia.
ITA_colonial_rifles_production코0=Colonial Rifles Production

ITA_operazione_plautius코0=Operazione Plautius
ITA_operazione_plautius_desc코0=For years we had to do with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean, condemning us to the background in terms of influence in the Mediterranean.

ITA_regia_aeronautica_2_desc코0=The war in Abyssinia allowed us for the first time to use our air force in times of war, the latter having been established in 1923. However, many of our aircraft are still quite old, including biplanes, which we will have to modernize.
newfocus_99_desc코0=Developed and manufactured by Savoia-Marchetti, the SM.79 Sparviero has three engines. Originally intended to be a transport aircraft, this project caught the attention of the Italian government because of its ability to be a much faster bomber than any other.

ITA_cant_z_1011_desc코0=Designed by Filippo Zappata, the CANT Z.1011 is a small wonder. It is a twin-engine low-wing bomber. The first tests revealed a formidable effectiveness in the destruction of infrastructure and would prove very useful to accomplish this task in times of war.
ITA_further_pilots_training코0=Further Pilots Training
ITA_further_pilots_training_desc코0=The last point on which we should modernise our air force is at the level of the pilots themselves. The development of air combat training will allow us to train a new generation of pilots much more talented than the previous one.
