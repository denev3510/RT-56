#r56
NOR_not_making_faction_warning_tt코0=§RWarning! Picking this option will block off the "Approach" focuses, as they require you to have a faction and be its leader.§!\n
##naval
NOR_encourage_fishing코0=Encourage Fishing
NOR_encourage_fishing_desc코0=By encouraging use of our long coastline and the surrounding rich fishing grounds, our economy could benefit.
NOR_establish_nortraship코0=Establish Nortraship
NOR_establish_nortraship_desc코0=Norwegian shipowners have hundreds of modern merchant vessels ferrying cargo around the world. We should make a state organization to commandeer and administer these ships in times of need.
NOR_establish_nortraship_tt코0=\nWith §YNortraship§! established, we'll not only be able to take direct control of our merchant fleet, we'll also be able to potentially delegate control of our merchant fleet to important allies.\n
NOR_landing_crafts코0=Nortraship Landing Crafts
NOR_landing_crafts_desc코0=Nortraship and our established maritime companies are developing new landing crafts for our forces. The Navy is considering establishing specialized troops for utilizing such vessels.
NOR_navy코0=Naval Buildup
NOR_navy_desc코0=The Fleet has always been the strength of Norway. We should not neglect this grand legacy.
NOR_nortraship_production_incentives코0=Nortraship Production Incentives
NOR_nortraship_production_incentives_desc코0=The merchant vessels and convoys are defenseless by themselves. We should therefore incentivize naval production, and maybe gather ship designers specialized for the needs of our merchant fleet.
NOR_nortraship_production_incentives_tt코0=\n§YNortraship Escort Docks§! will become available as a ship designer.\n
NOR_coastal_defense_specialization코0=Coastal Defense Specialization
NOR_coastal_defense_specialization_desc코0=By focusing the efforts of our well established naval industries and the Norwegian Navy, we could come up with ship designs and tactics developed specifically for Norwegian needs. This would most likely mean a coastal defense fleet capable of both supporting land based troops along the coast, as well as doing limited hit and run operations on the High Seas.
NOR_naval_equipment코0=Naval Equipment
NOR_naval_equipment_desc코0=The modernization of our naval equipment is essential in order to ensure that our navy has a chance against the major powers. And while a modern hull is designed to be fast and durable, it's just a piece of drifting metal without proper guns, shells and control systems.
NOR_escorts코0=Modern Escort Ships
NOR_escorts_desc코0=With our large trade fleet we should use modern escort ships to defend them from potential raiding.
NOR_submarines코0=Submarine Development

NOR_develop_naval_tactics코0=Continue Tordenskjold's Legacy
NOR_develop_naval_tactics_desc코0=Bold and inventive naval tactics marked the career of our national hero, vice admiral Peter Wessel Tordenskjold. As he proved, innovation and clever tactics at sea can win battles, and even wars. Let's honor this legacy.
NOR_capital_ships코0=Capital Ships
NOR_capital_ships_desc코0=We should consider making some capital ships of our own to support our lighter escort ships. Improving our production facilities should let us produce these modern capital ships without issues.
NOR_capital_ships_tt코0=\nAn improved version of §YHorten Naval Yard§! will be unlocked.\nShould you currently have them as a §YShip Designer§! this focus will §Gswitch to the upgraded version for free§!.\n\n

NOR_navy_wing_desc코0=Let us further develop our Navy Wing so that it may support the Navy when it operates along the coast.
NOR_carriers코0=Carriers
NOR_carriers_desc코0=Although our long coast gives our planes good reach, a carrier based fleet could provide even better reach with airfields that are able to move where they're needed.
##air
NOR_air_bases코0=Air Bases
NOR_air_bases_desc코0=With the long distances within our country, building air bases around said country might be for the best if we are to provide our planes with the bases and fuel they need to operate properly.
NOR_merge_the_air_wings코0=Merge the Air Wings
NOR_merge_the_air_wings_desc코0=With our small air wings and disjointed aerial command, it might be for the better to merge the Army Wing and the Navy Wing under one command. So let us found a third branch of the Norwegian Military, the Norwegian Air Force.
NOR_light_fighters코0=Light Fighters

NOR_medium_aircraft코0=Medium Aircraft
NOR_medium_aircraft_desc코0=We should consider making some planes with longer reach so we can defend our seas while operating off the Norwegian coast.
NOR_resurrect_norsk_aeroplanfabrik코0=Resurrect Norsk Aeroplanfabrik
NOR_resurrect_norsk_aeroplanfabrik_desc코0=By bringing back Norsk Aeroplanfabrik, a domestic aircraft factory, we could lessen our depence on foreign imports, and ensure a continuous supply of new and replacement airplanes and airplane parts, where the supply would otherwise have been disrupted.
##army
NOR_army코0=The Norwegian Army
NOR_army_desc코0=Hæren, or the Army, while economically neglected, still has a lot of expertise and talented people. Let us see what we can do to build further on this, even if economic limitations apply.
NOR_army_wing코0=Army Wing
NOR_army_wing_desc코0=Let us further develop our Army Wing so that it may support the Army in land based operations.
NOR_winter_tactics코0=Ski Infantry
NOR_winter_tactics_desc코0=In 1747 the world's first official ski-corps was established here in Norway, and since then the use of skis has become widely adopted in our Army. The benefits of our servicemen having this skill become apparent in wintertime and in higher altitudes.
NOR_winter_tactics_tt코0=Enables §HSki Infantry§!\n§HLand units:\n    Mountain§!: Attack: §G+10%§!\n§H    Mountain§!: Movement: §G+10%§!\n§H
NOR_mountaineers코0=Mountaineers
NOR_mountaineers_desc코0=Although our country has many people talented in traversing the mountains, adding military specialisation on top of this will allow some to truly excel at mountain operations. With such specialized troops the Germans dealt horrible defeats to the Italians during the Great War, proving that specialized troops are worth our time.
NOR_mountaineers_tt코0=\nWe can now deploy §YMountaineer Divisions§!.\n\n
NOR_urban_defenses코0=Urban Defenses
NOR_urban_defenses_desc코0=We should fortify all our important cities to safeguard them from potential invasions. In addition to fortifications around select cities, a defensive line should be established from Halden to the great Glomma river. Such a defensive line could be vital to prevent invaders coming from the Swedish border regions from threatening the urban areas of the inner Oslo Fjord.
NOR_urban_defenses_tt코0=\nEnables §Ydecisions§! to construct the §YGlomma-Halden defensive line§! and the §YLyngen defensive line§!.\n
NOR_jegerbataljonene코0=Merge Jegerbataljonene

A new idea has recently surfaced; to increase the punch of our limited numbers, we should concentrate our power into larger military formations. To accomplish this we'll now combine the battalions into a new formation, 1. Jegerdivisjon.
NOR_jegerbataljonene_tt코0=Gain an §Yelite infantry division§! in Østlandet.\n
NOR_continued_motorization_efforts코0=Continued Motorization Efforts
NOR_continued_motorization_efforts_desc코0=Although the motorization of the Army has already been planned and implemented to a degree, continuing this so larger portions of our Army can respond quickly would do us good. In addition to transporting our forces themselves, trucks could also transport supplies and provide mobile field hospitals for our forces.
NOR_bicycle_battalions코0=Bicycle Battalions
NOR_bicycle_battalions_desc코0=Fuel is not something that comes cheap, and rather than risking our troops being halted by an eventual fuel shortage, making use of the versatile bicycle for our army might seem prudent. Thus we should establish new bicycle battalions to better enable our troops to move about our cities and rural areas.
NOR_armored_battalions코0=Armored Battalions
NOR_armored_battalions_desc코0=To break the stalemate of the Great War, Britain and France developed great armored war machines, impervious to most of the devastating machine gun fire of the western front. Now, new tactics, engines, frames and guns have made these armored vehicles more powerful than ever, and so we should try to catch up to the major powers in this regard, even at the cost of large fuel expenses.
NOR_armored_battalions_tt코0=\n\nA Norwegian Panzer Program to catch up to the great powers of Europe and North America would greatly benefit from being in an §Yalliance§! with a major tank developing nation, or being in any §Ytechnology sharing group§!. Preferably both.\n
NOR_equipment_effort코0=Equipment Effort
NOR_equipment_effort_desc코0=The basic infantry is the backbone of every army. We must make sure they always have the best equipment.
NOR_encourage_recreational_shooting코0=Encourage Recreational Shooting
NOR_encourage_recreational_shooting_desc코0=Norway is a country containing many people using weapons for sports and hunting. Encouraging this should see our country's general weapon proficiency and survival skills increase.
NOR_encourage_recreational_shooting_tt코0=\nCompleting this focus will enable §YDisruptive Crossfire§!, a new defensive tactic utilizing accurate small arms fire from concealed positions to delay the enemy.\n
NOR_heimevernet코0=Heimevernet
NOR_heimevernet_desc코0=Let us establish a battle group to take the first blow of a foreign invasion. With regular training, a rapidly deployed Home Guard could be surprisingly useful.
NOR_fund_the_rearmament코0=Fund the Rearmament
NOR_fund_the_rearmament_desc코0=Let us do something about the neglect and lack of resources that has plagued our armed forces.
NOR_fund_the_rearmament_tt코0=Some of our commanders will become available as §YTheorists§!.\n\n
NOR_a_serious_defense_budget코0=A Serious Defense Budget

NOR_kongsberg_research코0=Kongsberg Research
NOR_kongsberg_research_desc코0=Our armament developers in Kongsberg can now expanded their research wing through some additional funding. This should help us keep up with modern developments.
NOR_de_norske_statsbaner코0=De norske Statsbaner
NOR_de_norske_statsbaner_desc코0=De norske Statsbaner, the Norwegian State Railways, was established in 1883 as a joint state company for all railroads opened since 1861. Funding further railroad projects in Southern Norway could have long term benefits for the economy.
NOR_nordlandsbanen코0=Finish the Nordland Line
NOR_nordlandsbanen_desc코0=Nordlandsbanen, the Nordland Line, has been an ongoing project by the Norwegian State Railways since the 1920s. By funding the contruction of these railways we can speed up this process and connect our sparsely populated, yet resource rich, northern counties to the rest of the nation.
NOR_norsk_jernverk코0=A/S Norsk Jernverk
NOR_norsk_jernverk_desc코0=Let us establish a common company to keep us supplied with iron, steel and other metals.

NOR_invest_in_district_industries코0=District Investments
NOR_invest_in_district_industries_desc코0=Let us invest in our districts and rural areas. With local producers and services our people can make use of every nook and cranny of the country.
NOR_nth코0=NTH
NOR_nth_desc코0=Much of our national expertise can be found at Norges tekniske høiskole, the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim. By embracing and funding this institution for higher learning we could prosper. Maybe we can even expand it into a university in time?
NOR_tungtvann코0=Invest in the Heavy Water Facilities
NOR_tungtvann_desc코0=While Norsk Hydro's industrial facilities and research labs at Vemork and Rjukan already provide us with power and useful chemicals, the surplus heavy water they produce should also help us advance in hitherto unexplored fields of science. Maybe there's even a potential military application? It's probably not worth dwelling on this, though.
NOR_norsk_hydro_focus코0=Norsk Hydro

NOR_hydroelectric_power_generation_desc코0=While the decades since the 1890s have already seen us establishing many hydroelectric power plants, including some which at the time were among the biggest hydro plants in the world, there's yet potential to build more, increase electricity production, bringing modern comforts to our people, and even fuelling our heavy industries. What are we even waiting for?
NOR_expanded_aluminium_production코0=Expanded Aluminium Production
NOR_expanded_aluminium_production_desc코0=We should use the surplus energy from our hydro plants to fuel and expand our aluminium works. This has already been done to great success at Høyanger by Norsk Aluminium Co.

##democratic branch
NOR_affirm_constitutional_monarchy코0=Affirm Constitutional Monarchy
NOR_affirm_constitutional_monarchy_desc코0=By affirming our current mix of the old and new, we can be sure that Hans Majestet Kongens Garde, His Majesty the King's Guard, will always be ready to take up arms to defend their King and inspire our people. Safety for people both high and low is of paramount importance to any state worth its salt.
NOR_continuous_politics코0=Continuous Politics
NOR_continuous_politics_desc코0=Let us give our current Government continuous trust in their political course. This country is, after all, built on mutual trust.
NOR_continuous_politics_tt코0=\nEnables a §Ydecision§! to finish the welfare programs of the Nygaardsvold Government, intent to combat the Great Depression and its effects.\n\n
NOR_change_starts_within코0=Change starts from within...
NOR_change_starts_within_desc코0=Rather than continuing our risky path, or tossing the Government aside, we could do some internal changes, switching people around and inviting people from other parties to collaborate and provide advice. A shift towards the Farmers' Party's more moderate politics rather than the Labour Party's politics could help us here.
NOR_motion_of_no_confidence코0=Motion of No Confidence
NOR_motion_of_no_confidence_desc코0=The Government has shown themselves blind to the increasing tension in the rest of the world. A new course is needed.
NOR_seek_a_british_alliance코0=Seek a British Alliance
NOR_seek_a_british_alliance_desc코0=Let's go into an alliance with the British Empire. Having the power of the Royal Navy on our side should deter many an attacker, and due to our close historical ties, our odds of making it happen should be good.

The joint high command and military exercises would also do our militaries good, though maybe ours more so due to the mismatch in power.
NOR_north_atlantic_defense_focus_tt코0=Forms the §YNorth Atlantic Defense Initiative§! with the North Atlantic Commonwealth nations. The tightly knit cooperation and joint high command should see Allied troops and commanders perform better over time as they learn from their allies. As our allies go into this agreement, they may also be inspired to rearm like we have.\n\nDepending on which policy of rearmament we've chosen before, our North Atlantic Defense Policy may vary somewhat.\n\n
NOR_american_military_support코0=Seek American Military Support
NOR_american_military_support_desc코0=Now that the United States has become our ally, we could seek some military support from their experts. With their vast resources they're bound to have something to teach us, and a stronger ally will benefit them in return.

NOR_delegate_control_of_the_merchant_fleet_desc코0=Now finding ourselves in a common war with the British, it might be time to strike a deal with them about delegation of our large merchant fleet. Key points for us have been that our shipping industry remains competetive after victory has been assured, and that our sailors get fair salaries. With this in order, the British could let us procure small warships and submarines at a discount in return.
NOR_armed_neutrality_once_more코0=Armed Neutrality Once More
NOR_armed_neutrality_once_more_desc코0=It is the belief of many of our politicians and statesmen that our best course of action against coming conflicts would be to continue our Armed Neutrality from the time of the Great War, in the event that conflict would once more strike Europe. With a decent military we could deter attackers, and should we be attacked, we could always join forces with the adversaries of our would-be attackers...
NOR_armed_neutrality_once_more_tt코0=\nAttempt to keep [Root.GetNameDef] neutral. Should an aggressor violate our §YNeutrality§!, the Armed Neutrality focus will enable §Ydecisions§! to petition major powers for alliances.\n
NOR_three_brothers코0=Three Brothers

NOR_the_dano-norwegian_deal_tt코0=\nFor the §Yland transfers§! and §Y[DEN.GetAdjective]§! core on Slesvig-Holsten to take effect, §Y[DEN.GetNameDef]§! will need to agree to our proposal. §GBetter relations§! would likely lead to better outcomes here.\n\n
NOR_the_fennoscandian_deal코0=The Fennoscandian Deal
NOR_the_fennoscandian_deal_desc코0=With Sweden and Finland in the alliance, pragmatics from all three nations have reached a secretive deal intending to shift the borders of all three Fennoscandian nations to the east and secure Finland's eastern border. Sweden cedes the formerly Norwegian Båhuslen to Norway, Finland renounces the Åland convention, and if an eventual Soviet attack is defeated, Karelia goes to Finland.
NOR_the_fennoscandian_deal_tt코0=\nUnlike the Dano-Norwegian deal, the Fennoscandian deal is so §Gmutually beneficial§! to all that we can ensure acceptance by all sides as long as §YSweden§! and §YFinland§! remain in our alliance. However, we do risk increasing §RRussian wariness§! towards our faction by agreeing to defend Finland's eastern borders.\n\n
NOR_seek_american_support코0=Seek American Support
NOR_seek_american_support_desc코0=By utilizing trading ties, helpful Nordic Americans, and our similar values, we could attempt to get into the Americans' good books. Thus they may later support us or protect us should we need it. But there's no guarantee this will work, the Americans do value their neutrality and peace...
NOR_pragmatic_diplomacy코0=Pragmatic Diplomacy
NOR_pragmatic_diplomacy_desc코0=Even with a united Northern Europe, we cannot hope to stand against an attack from both the Germans and the Russians. If we are to survive we must petition the major powers for help, and even that might not be enough. Taking a side might be our only choice...
NOR_stand_against_communism코0=A Stand Against Communism
NOR_stand_against_communism_desc코0=Taking Germany's side, entailing non-aggression pacts, free trade and free Baltic shipping, might be for the better, but the Danes might not like it since we promised them Slesvig. And the Russians surely won't like it...
NOR_stand_against_communism_tt코0=\nTaking sides might be necessary to avoid a two front war, and those we approach will tend to leave us alone or even §Gbefriend§! us. But the scorned side will be more likely to §Rattack§! us.\n
NOR_stand_against_fascism코0=A Stand Against Fascism
NOR_stand_against_fascism_desc코0=Taking Russia's side, entailing non-aggression pacts, free trade and somewhat set eastern borders, might be for the better, but the Finns might not like us taking sides with Russia and working against Germany, claiming it's not their fight and that the Russians will just come back once Germany is down. And the Germans surely won't like it...
NOR_stand_against_fascism_tt코0=\nTaking sides might be necessary to avoid a two front war, and those we approach will tend to leave us alone or even §Gbefriend§! us. But the scorned side will be more likely to §Rattack§! us.\n

NOR_nordic_joint_defense_focus_tt코0=Forms the §YNordic joint Defense Initiative§! with the other Nordic faction members. The tightly knit cooperation and joint high command should see Nordic troops and commanders perform better over time as they learn from their allies. As our allies go into this agreement, they may also be inspired to rearm like we have.\n\nDepending on which policy of rearmament we've chosen before, our Nordic Defense Policy may vary somewhat.\n\n
NOR_the_brotherhood_of_nations코0=Brotherhood of Democratic Nations
NOR_the_brotherhood_of_nations_desc코0=Our alliance is long overdue a name change, especially considering we've now passed the point of being an alliance of just three brothers. Rebranding ourselves the Brotherhood of Democratic Nations and involving a couple more peaceful European nations should keep our diplomatic momentum going.

NOR_saboteurs코0=Saboteurs
NOR_saboteurs_desc코0=With a resistance movement in place, it might be time to train some of our partisans to participate in clandestine sabotage operations behind enemy lines.

##monarchist branch
NOR_traditions_and_monarchy코0=Rekindle Monarchist Traditions
NOR_traditions_and_monarchy_desc코0=There are many that advocate for care in these uncertain times. And what better way to take care is there then than seeking back to our tried and tested roots once more. Rekindling the traditional has actually been important for those in power for some time now.
NOR_traditions_and_monarchy_tt코0=\n§YFredrik Wedel Jarlsberg§! will become available as an advisor. Having a §YStaunch Monarchist§! as our advisor will allow special §YDecisions§! in preparation for a §RCivil War§! or other monarchist takeover.\n\n
NOR_develop_the_kingdom코0=Develop the Kingdom
NOR_develop_the_kingdom_desc코0=We should start our path towards creating the ideal Kingdom by building a solid infrastructure for it. A strong foundation will most certainly be needed to carry the state, our people, and our values.
NOR_traditions_worth_fighting_for코0=Traditions Worth Fighting for
NOR_traditions_worth_fighting_for_desc코0=With Monarchism and traditional values growing in popularity by the day, the question arises of how we're going to get our newfound values in power. Do we wait for the elections? Launch a coup? Or do we fight if it comes to it?
NOR_traditions_worth_fighting_for_tt코0=\nCould potentially result in a §RCivil War§!.\n
NOR_matters_of_presentation코0=Matters of Presentation
NOR_matters_of_presentation_desc코0=With our traditional Kingdom being restored, some question how we want to present our nation to the outside world, and indeed our own population. The first matters which arise are the issue of keeping or lifting the discontinuation of aristocracy, and maybe of our national symbolism, specifically our flag.
NOR_the_location_of_power코0=The Location of Power
NOR_the_location_of_power_desc코0=Another matter of symbolism and presentation is our capital city and how it's presented to the world. And maybe most important, where should it be located, literally and geographically speaking?
NOR_matters_of_practicality코0=Matters of Practicality
NOR_matters_of_practicality_desc코0=Our followers have led us through the important first steps towards restoring a nation of old values. But we must take a stance on who shall lead the Monarchist coalition through its important first steps and reforms...
NOR_the_extent_of_power코0=The Extent of Power
NOR_the_extent_of_power_desc코0=With the coalition ready to act, the last practical matter we need to decide on now is the definition of the Monarch's Powers. Exactly what can the King decide? Should we simply be a modern Constitutional Monarchy promoting family values? Should the King have more than symbolic power? Does the Prime Minister answer to the King? And what about our elections?
NOR_foreign_relations코0=Bolster Foreign Relations
NOR_foreign_relations_desc코0=Establishing solid diplomatic and trading ties with other nations we can improve our chances of staying out of harms way in the case of another European War, should we wish to continue our stance of neutrality.
NOR_foreign_relations_tt코0=\nPlacating §YBritain§! and §YGermany§! should make any immediate hostilities against us unlikely.\n\n
NOR_the_nordic_policy코0=The Nordic Policy
NOR_the_nordic_policy_desc코0=The most immediate (and thus also most important) diplomatic questions of any country will always be those relating to the immediate neighbors. Should we befriend the other Nordic countries, or should a Norwegian State exert force abroad for the first time in more than half a millenium?
NOR_reclaim_the_islands코0=Reclaim the Islands
NOR_reclaim_the_islands_desc코0=If the Norwegian Kingdom is truly to be restored to its former glory, we need to reclaim the formerly Norwegian Islands of the Faroes, Iceland and Greenland, unjustly given to Denmark by the treaty of Kiel.
NOR_icelandic-faroese_revolt코0=Icelandic-Faroese Revolt
NOR_icelandic-faroese_revolt_desc코0=Since we find ourselves in conflict with the Danes, we could instigate revolts in Iceland and the Faroes, former Norwegian islands with more historical and cultural ties to Norway than to Denmark. This should see the Faroes annexed to Norway, while Iceland joins our cause indirectly as a dependant, yet autonomous territory.
NOR_icelandic-faroese_revolt_tt코0=\nTransfers ownership of the §YFaroe Islands§! to us, and makes §YIceland§! an autonomous §Ysubject§! of ours.\n\n
NOR_develop_iceland코0=Develop Iceland
NOR_develop_iceland_desc코0=With Iceland under our control we should develop this spacious island, rich in water, hardy laborers, plentiful fishing grounds and healthy sheep. The outlying areas of our country should of course also be able to contribute to our efforts.
NOR_develop_the_faroes코0=Develop the Faroes
NOR_develop_the_faroes_desc코0=With the Faroes back under our control there is little reason not to make use of their resources, fish, whales and sheep, for industry.
NOR_develop_the_jarldom_of_orkney코0=Develop the Jarldom of Orkney
NOR_develop_the_jarldom_of_orkney_desc코0=The old Jarldom of Orkney, now under our control, is certainly a prestigious territory in istelf, but with more industry it could have more material contributions for us as well.
NOR_reclaim_the_mainland코0=Reclaim the Mainland
NOR_reclaim_the_mainland_desc코0=Even if Norway has held many different islands throughout its existence, the mainland and mainland-connected islands have always been the center of power, economy and population throughout Norway's history. In the mid 1600s, Sweden cut into this long held Norwegian mainland, and we should take our chance to get back what is rightfully ours!
NOR_subjugate_finland코0=Subjugate Finland
NOR_subjugate_finland_desc코0=While Finland does not hold any land that have ever been integral Norwegian lands, as we've now reclaimed at least some of our previous integral lands, we could justify using force again to bring Finland into the sphere and secure our eastern flank. Of course the Finns would also benefit from this protection in the long run. Should we send an ultimatum?
NOR_approach_denmark코0=Approach Denmark
NOR_approach_denmark_desc코0=The Danes would do best as our friends. They did not take any lands from us by force (rather through treaty by the Great Powers), and the trade partnership worked well during union times. Proposing an alliance to the Danish would thus seem like a good course of action.
NOR_approach_sweden코0=Approach Sweden
NOR_approach_sweden_desc코0=The Swedes would make excellent friends to the Norwegians. It was only due to the Danes excessive meddling that they had to invade Norway in the past. After all, it often cost them dearly as well. Let us therefore forgive and befriend our brothers in the east. We'd do well to remember that during union times with Sweden and their lenient rule, our economy and culture prospered.
NOR_approach_finland코0=Approach Finland
NOR_approach_finland_desc코0=The Finns have never been enemies of Norway of their own free will, as the Finnish soldiers that invaded Norway were under orders from aggressive Swedish Kings. And was it not a Kven woman who risked her safety to thwart one of these Swedish invasions? The Finns may be some of the most natural allies to the Norwegian people, so who could then be more worthy of an alliance than our cousins in the east?
NOR_the_european_policy코0=The European Policy
NOR_the_european_policy_desc코0=With the homeland somewhat seen to, keeping an eye on the shifting political nature of Europe would seem prudent. After all, keeping troubles away is better than having them come to us.
NOR_take_no_sides코0=Take no Sides
NOR_take_no_sides_desc코0=With the exception of Finland which was part of the Russian Empire, the Nordic nations stayed out of the Great War with great success. And while it did indeed take its toll on neutral shipping, the Norwegian state was compensated even as a neutral state as the Entente took advantage of Norwegian shipping. Why then shouldn't we strive to ensure Northern Europe stays out of destructive conflicts once more?
NOR_a_piece_in_the_greater_game코0=A Piece in the Greater Game
NOR_a_piece_in_the_greater_game_desc코0=If we are to truly be taken seriously in the world, we need to be proactive and help shape it. To do this we should either take a side with one of the great powers agreeing with our viewpoints, or maybe we should reach out to other local powers and help combat the threats to our traditional state?
NOR_the_british_empire코0=The British Empire
NOR_the_british_empire_desc코0=If we side with the Greatest Empire there ever was, we surely can't lose. This is truly a safe choice if they'll have us, and siding with the winners always brings some influence to the henchmen. Though said influence may be reduced by the standing of the big shots as compared to us.
NOR_a_deal_with_britain코0=A Deal with Britain
NOR_a_deal_with_britain_desc코0=By helping the United Kingdom uphold their Empire, we could maybe get some of our old islands, illegally pawned by Denmark, back in exchange. After all, what difference does the Shetlands and Orkney make to a World spanning Empire?
NOR_a_deal_with_britain_tt코0=\nSends a deal requesting the transfer of §YShetland§! and §YOrkney§! to us. Britain may §Gaccept§! this, decide to limit it to just §YShetland§!, or §Rdecline§!. Having §Ggood relations§! and being a useful ally will increase the likelyhood of a §Ggood outcome§!.\n
NOR_the_north_sea_deal코0=The North Sea Deal
NOR_the_north_sea_deal_desc코0=As Germany and Britain draw closer to each other, we too shall join in this bonding of nations. Maybe we can negotiate the return of the Shetlands for helping the major powers overcome their enemies?
NOR_the_north_sea_deal_tt코0=\nSends a deal to Britain asking for the return of §YShetland§! to us. They may either §Gaccept§! or §Rreject§! this. Having §Ggood relations§! and being a useful ally will increase the likelyhood of a §Ggood outcome§!.\n
NOR_the_german_kaiserreich코0=The German Kaiserreich
NOR_the_german_kaiserreich_desc코0=If we join forces with the resurgent Kaiserreich, we could increase our influence in the world massively. Unlike siding with the British this is more of a risk, as they're not nearly as influential and powerful relatively to the Second iterration of the German Kaiserreich, but the rewards are potentially greater for us...
NOR_a_deal_with_germany코0=A Deal with Germany
NOR_a_deal_with_germany_desc코0=If we help Germany overturn the treaty of Versailles, it is only fair that we get some of our old islands out of this as well. And in this case that means the Shetland and Orkney islands. Surely the Kaiser will agree to such reasonable demands.
NOR_baltic_anti-communist_league코0=Baltic Anti-Communist League
NOR_baltic_anti-communist_league_desc코0=Communism may be the greatest threat there ever was towards monarchy and traditional family values. Seeking out likeminded Governments in Eastern Europe and the Baltics could, if things go as planned, truly form a magnificent deterrent against the all-corrupting Bolsheviks.
NOR_baltic_league_strikes_west코0=The Great Western Spearhead
NOR_baltic_league_strikes_west_desc코0=While the intial idea of the alliance may have been to deter the Bolsheviks in the east, western fascists and aggressors have recently become a huge threat on their own. Should the alliance jointly put the threat down before it grows out of hand?
NOR_baltic_league_deterrence코0=Baltic League Deterrence Policy
NOR_baltic_league_deterrence_desc코0=Our alliance is mainly defensive in its workings, let's deter any would-be attackers, and make them pay should they come for our great cross-Baltic Alliance.
NOR_baltic_league_strikes_east코0=The Great Eastern Spearhead
NOR_baltic_league_strikes_east_desc코0=The Baltic League was formed largely in response to the Bolshevik threat to more moderate countries sovereignty and way of life. Let us end this threat once and for all, before it burns down all we hold dear.
##collectivist branch
NOR_reject_constitutional_monarchy코0=Reject Constitutional Monarchy
NOR_reject_constitutional_monarchy_desc코0=The King stands in the way of the true path. Just as roadblocks should be moved, so should stubborn royalty abdicate! With some party propaganda campaigns for modern authoritarianism and collectivism, we can overthrow the archaic system and bring about some real change.
##fascist sub-branch
NOR_support_radical_nationalism코0=Support Radical Nationalism
NOR_support_radical_nationalism_desc코0=We should support our only true nationalist party, Nasjonal Samling, led by the dynamic Vidkun Quisling.
NOR_hirden_est코0=Hirden
NOR_hirden_est_desc코0=The personal retinue and bodyguard of our medieval Kings was called Hirden, the Hird. Let us reestablish such guard, now loyal to nationalist ideals and party leaders instead of a King.
NOR_rinnanbanden코0=Rinnanbanden
NOR_rinnanbanden_desc코0=Some men loyal to our cause is offering their help at infiltrating any possible resistance or dissenters.
NOR_rinnanbanden_tt코0=\n§YHenry Oliver Rinnan§! will become available as an advisor.\n
NOR_norway_first코0=Norway First
NOR_norway_first_desc코0=We should restore Norway to its former Glory.
NOR_reclaim_danish코0=Reclaim Danish-held Lands
NOR_reclaim_danish_desc코0=Let us move to reclaim the lands lost to Denmark, forgotten after the Napoleonic Wars and subsequent Treaty of Kiel.
NOR_reclaim_swedish코0=Reclaim Swedish-held Lands
NOR_reclaim_swedish_desc코0=Let us move to reclaim the lands lost to Sweden during the wars between Denmark and Sweden.
NOR_join_axis코0=Join the Axis
NOR_join_axis_desc코0=Going into an alliance with our brother people in the Third Reich could only do us good. Let's start by building some relations and ensuring peace between our nations.
NOR_invite_terboven코=Invite Terboven
NOR_invite_terboven_desc코0=As a small nation we can't do everything on our own. Let us invite German expertise to help govern and build our country.
NOR_invite_terboven_tt코0=§YJosef Terboven§! will become available as a §YPolitical Advisor§!.\n
NOR_festung_norwegen코0=Festung Norwegen
NOR_festung_norwegen_desc코0=The idea of making our entire coastline a fortress is possible, but it demands an effort. We certainly didn't believe otherwise.
NOR_german_puppet코0=Accept German Rule
NOR_german_puppet_desc코0=With the German military on the attack against our nation, certain fascist proponents have suggested that we might be better off in the long run by giving in to the Germans. There is a good chance that they'd take kindly to us accepting German influence and usage of our Naval bases, in return for lenient terms by them.
NOR_german_technology_sharing코0=German Technology Sharing
NOR_german_technology_sharing_desc코0=Let us expand our cooperation with the Germans with a research agreement. Their expertise in things such as industry, encryption technology and armored vehicles could benefit us greatly.
NOR_german_technology_sharing_tt코0=Invite Germany to form a §Ytechnology sharing group§! with us.\n\nHaving very good relations would likely ensure their acceptance.\n\n
NOR_expand_german_technology_sharing코0=Expand the German Technology Sharing
NOR_expand_german_technology_sharing_desc코0=Import German experts to help with our research, while developing even closer ties with the Germans and their allies.
NOR_german_naval_coordination코0=German Naval Coordination
NOR_german_naval_coordination_desc코0=With our large merchant marine we'll surely be an asset to the Germans. In return for delegating control of some of it we should be able to order ships and submarines from them at a discounted rate. A strong Norwegian presence on the Seas will surely benefit our alliance immensely.
NOR_at_any_cost코0=At any Cost
NOR_at_any_cost_desc코0=Driven by ideology and the greater good, some of our fighter pilots are willing to sacrifice it all. We will honor their great sacrifice by leading the nation to greatness.
NOR_demand_the_northern_isles코0=Demand the Northern Isles
NOR_demand_the_northern_isles_desc코0=Demand the land lost through illegal Danish pawnings, held by us up until the late middle ages. If we are to claim British territory, this is the place to start. The inhabitants of the Shetlands and Orkney have significant amounts of old Norwegian heritage, and they'd do well in our new nation. As for Caithness, it was an integral part of the Norwegian earldom of Orkney, and thus it should follow.
NOR_demand_colonies코0=Demand British Colonies
NOR_demand_colonies_desc코0=Norway has always been a seafaring nation, and we could certainly have been a colonial Empire had the Danes not held us back for 300 dark years. Let us seek to remedy this by demanding our rightful share of the British Colonial Empire.
NOR_demand_scottish코0=Demand Scottish Land
NOR_demand_scottish_desc코0=Parts of Scotland were part of Norway from the Viking age throughout the medieval period. Let us use this to leverage the major powers to give us Scotland when a peace treaty is signed.
NOR_demand_russian코0=Demand Russian Land
NOR_demand_russian_desc코0=Vidkun Quisling himself wants to set up Norwegian colonies in Northern Russia now that we have joined in the fight against Bolshevism, as is our prize for the struggles we go through to rid the world of the red plague. One of our medieval Kings claimed all land before the White Sea as Norwegian, so let's start by staking our claim there, closest to home.
NOR_demand_russian_tt코0=\nThis focus will also send a demand for §YPetsamo§! to §YFinland§!, should they own the state. Finnish acceptance to cede land is more likely with being in the same §Yfaction§!, §Ggood relations§!, or having a §Gstrong army§!.\nTo ensure it, we need to either have them as a §Ypuppet§!, or have membership in the same §Yfaction§!, §Ggood relations§! and a §Gstrong army§! at once.\n
##communist sub-branch
NOR_support_radical_socialism코0=Support Radical Socialism
NOR_support_radical_socialism_desc코0=We should support the true way of Norges Kommunistiske Parti, the Norwegian Communist Party. Adam Egede-Nissen's party will surely lead the people to power and equality.
NOR_join_comintern코0=Join the Comintern
NOR_join_comintern_desc코0=Going into an alliance with the powerful and equality concerned Soviet Union could only do us good. Let's start by building some relations and ensuring peace between our states.
NOR_soviet_technology_sharing코0=Soviet Technology Sharing
NOR_soviet_technology_sharing_desc코0=Let us expand our cooperation with the Soviets with a research agreement. Their industrial techniques and armored vehicle development could benefit us.

NOR_expand_soviet_technology_sharing코0=Expand the Soviet Technology Sharing

NOR_folkearmeen코0=Folkestyrken
NOR_folkearmeen_desc코0=Establish Folkestyrken, the People's Force, a grand and loyal force guarding our Party officials.
NOR_unite_the_scandinavian_workers코0=Unite the Scandinavian Workers
NOR_unite_the_scandinavian_workers_desc코0=Now that we follow the path of true equality, it would be selfish not to share it with our Scandinavian brethren. Let's unite Scandinavia by any means necessary!
NOR_pressure_finland코0=Pressure Finland
NOR_pressure_finland_desc코0=Our defeat of our Scandinavian neighbors has not gone unnoticed around the world. The Nordic balance of power has been shifted, and with access to the resources and industries of Scandinavia we're a force to be reckoned with. Why then should we allow the Finns to stand in our way as we seek to deepen our ties to the Soviets? Surely their best course of action would be to submit to us.
NOR_pressure_finland_tt코0=\nAttempt to pressure Finland into being our §Ysubject state§!. A strong army will make their acceptance more likely.\nTo ensure it, we need very good relations, we need to be in faction with the Soviet Union, and both the Soviets and us need to have strong armies.\n\nShould Finland already be our subject this focus will reduce their §Yautonomy§!.\n\n
NOR_establish_a_secret_police코0=Establish a Secret Police
NOR_establish_a_secret_police_desc코0=Let's use the experience of our Russian comrades to establish a secret police, modelled after their \"Narodnyi Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del\", or NKVD. This would help us control our internal issues and public opinions, and thus make our country much more stable. After all, how could the integrity and opinion of the individual ever measure up to the stability and safety of the state as a whole?
NOR_perfect_state_propaganda코0=Perfect our State Propaganda
NOR_perfect_state_propaganda_desc코0=Propaganda is an art, and to mold the State and its People into an effective and oiled machine, we should perfect this art. When everyone knows their place and duty, so too shall Society and our People reap the rewards of our very own Utopia.
##for temporary tags (Note: Currently not used!)
NOR_recover_from_civil_war코0=Recover from the Civil War
NOR_recover_from_civil_war_desc코0=With us having managed to overcome our enemies in the recent civil war, we can now focus on rebuilding our broken country and its infrastructure. Trust will have to be reestablished between the different regions and people of Norway as well.

NOR_aftermath_of_the_depression코0=Aftermath of the Great Depression
NOR_aftermath_of_the_depression_desc코0=While Norway had several crises during the 1920s, most recently the Great Depression, the nation has not really been hit that hard this time, as compared to other western nations. While there's still elevated unemployment, Norwegian export and shipping industries are starting to boom, and the groundworks for Norway becoming a fully industrialized nation have been laid. If we cleverly invest money in the right places now, it could lift us out of the depression once and for all.

Our Navy has also adopted tactics to utilize this in the best possible way. While our ships will perform better than ever with these designs, they are also a bit more expensive to produce due to this.
NOR_policy_of_disarmament코0=Enduring Policy of Disarmament
NOR_policy_of_disarmament_desc코0=With the exception of German submarines hitting neutral shipping during the Great War, Norway and its people have faced no real military threats during the 1900s, and the Government has spent less and less on military matters, culminating with Johan Nygaardsvold's Government. At least funds are freed up for civilian matters.
NOR_meager_defense_budget코0=Meager Defense Budget

NOR_winter_training코0=Winter Training
NOR_winter_training_desc코0=Skis have been in Norway for ages and the army have likewise been using them for a long time. Now skiing will also be taught as a mandatory skill for all troops. This should grant us an overall advantage in winter conditions and snowy mountains.
NOR_recreational_shooting코0=Encouraged Recreational Shooting

NOR_haakon코0=Haakon VII

NOR_deterrence_investments_desc코0=The Grand Baltic anti-extremist and anti-Bolshevik alliance has decidedly put investments into military deterrence, so that any extremist countries threatening their sovereignty and territorial integrity will have to think hard whether to go through with any acts of aggression.

NOR_festung코0=Festung Norwegen
NOR_festung_desc코0=Festung Norwegen, or fortress Norway, is the idea of making the entire coastline of Norway into an impenetrable fortress, making our country impervious to western attacks. Since the Germans came up with the idea they also got to name it...

NOR_hirden's_air_corps_desc코0=With expansion of the modern Hird, it is no longer just a political, symbolic and paramilitary group, it is evolving into something more professional, now able to supplement even the actual Armed Forces.

NOR_rinnanbanden_idea코0=Rinnanbanden

NOR_pro-rearmament_politics_desc코0=There is finally a Governmental will to invest in our previously neglected armed forces. Let us use this while we can!
NOR_change코0=Changing turmoil
NOR_change_desc코0=The Motion of no Confidence is not without problems. With time our political situation will stabilize.
NOR_atlantic_balanced_policy코0=Balanced Atlantic Defense Policy
NOR_atlantic_balanced_policy_desc코0=With the recent Atlantic Defense Initiative, our Government has recognized that it needs to contribute to the defense of our alliance, and now strikes a more balanced policy between civilian matters and naval rearmament. The new combined high command and joint exercises should quickly bring our military up to a more professional standard, though the benefits to the larger powers may be somewhat limited.
NOR_atlantic_defense_policy코0=North Atlantic Centered Defense Policy
NOR_atlantic_defense_policy_desc코0=With the new Atlantic Defense Initiative our Government has received all the confirmation they needed that the choice to rearm was the right one, though some efforts must be spent to coordinate our defense needs with our allies, meaning more effort must go into the Navy. But in the end, the new combined high command and joint exercises should quickly bring our military up to a more professional standard, though the benefits to the larger powers may be somewhat limited.
NOR_nordic_balanced_policy코0=Balanced Policy of Defense
NOR_nordic_balanced_policy_desc코0=With the recent Nordic Defense Initiative, our Government has recognized that it needs to contribute to the defense of our alliance, and now strikes a more balanced policy between civilian matters and military rearmament.

##infiltration/sabotage ideas (generally temporary ideas)
NOR_intelligence_gathered코0=Intelligence Gathered
NOR_intelligence_gathered_desc코0=Norwegian Infiltrators and Resistance have managed to figure out the plans of those who occupy our territory. This will give us insight into their resources, as well as their plans for the near future.
NOR_intelligence_compromised코0=Intelligence Compromised
NOR_intelligence_compromised_desc코0=Foreign Infiltrators have managed to make off with documents containing vital information. Unfortunately this will mean they're able to more accurately assess our resources, as well as our plans for the immediate future.
NOR_resistance_strengthened코0=Norwegian Resistance Strengthened
NOR_resistance_strengthened_desc코0=Our Resistance movement and loyal infiltrators have managed to the enemy on occupied Norwegian territory. This civil support for our cause permeating occupied society should make their position less comfortable.
##country ideas/national spirits applied to other countries
NOR_north_atlantic_joint_defense코0=North Atlantic Joint Defense
NOR_north_atlantic_joint_defense_desc코0=With the new North Atlantic Defense Initiative, our alliance with our neighbors across the Sea is more closely knit than ever. The Norwegians have been rearming quickly, and we won't let them outdo us. To meet the standards expected by our new friends, production and recruitment will have to be increased. But with new responsibility, so comes new opportunities; a combined high command and joint exercises should see our military benefit somewhat.
NOR_nordic_joint_defense코0=Nordic joint Defense Initiative
NOR_nordic_joint_defense_desc코0=With the new Nordic Defense Initiative, our alliance with our neighbors is more closely knit than ever. The Norwegians have been rearming quickly, and we won't let them outdo us. To meet the standards expected by all our friends, production and recruitment will have to be increased.

NOR_norwegian_destroyer_order코0=Norwegian Destroyer Order
NOR_norwegian_destroyer_order_desc코0=Our Norwegian allies have ordered destroyers from our shipyards. While we get paid and this will strengthen our allies, it will of course slow down our own projects until the vessels are finished.
NOR_norwegian_destroyer_order_strong_shipbuilding코0=Norwegian Destroyer Order (Strong Shipbuilding Industry)
NOR_norwegian_destroyer_order_strong_shipbuilding_desc코0=Our Norwegian allies have ordered destroyers from our shipyards. In return we receive fair payment and a stronger ally. Due to our strong shipbuilding industry, our own projects should not be set back too much by contructing a couple of small vessels.
##designers
NOR_thunes_mekaniske_verksted코0=Thunes Mekaniske Verksted
NOR_thunes_mekaniske_verksted_desc코0=An important producer of turbines and various locomotives for our railroads, Thune's Mechanical Workshop could be appointed as our domestic tank producer. Since their facilities are already built to be able to handle large vehicles, they seem like the best choice for such an endeavour.\n
NOR_det_norske_luftfartselskap코0=Det Norske Luftfartselskap
horten_naval_yard_desc코0=Horten Verft, or Horten Naval Yard, serves as both the main base of the Royal Norwegian Navy and a domestic shipyard for the Navy. Last century, the base itself was named Karljohansvern after the King of former Sweden-Norway. Its functions were inherited from Fredriksvern in Stavern from 1850 onwards.\n
NOR_marinens_hovedverft코0=Marinens Hovedverft
NOR_marinens_hovedverft_desc코0=Horten Verft, or Horten Naval Yard, serves as both the main base of the Royal Norwegian Navy and a domestic shipyard for the Navy. Last century, the base itself was named Karljohansvern after the King of former Sweden-Norway. Its functions were inherited from Fredriksvern in Stavern from 1850 onwards.\n\nNow the facilities have been expanded for domestic production of capital ships, maybe first and foremost of coastal defense ships, so called \"Panserskip\", post-Monitor era armored ships. These heavy cruisers should work well as versatile, armored and affordable coastal defense ships for our Navy.\n
NOR_nortraship_dock_limited코0=Nortraship Escort Docks
NOR_nortraship_dock_limited_desc코0=Making use of the shipowners' expertise and interest in protecting the vessels they invested in, we can set up a new company for protecting our trade at sea.
NOR_tandbergs_radiofabrikk_desc코0=Tandbergs Radiofabrikk was established in 1933 by Civil Engineer Vebjørn Tandberg. The Oslo-based radio factory has seen rapid expansion, and it seems promising for Norwegian electronic industries and innovations, especially with regards to radio technologies and recording technologies.\n
NOR_norsk_hydro_desc코0=Initially going under the name \"Norsk Hydro-Elektrisk Kvælstofaktieselskab\" the company was founded by Sam Eyde and Kristian Birkeland in December of 1905, with finanicial backing from the Swedish Wallenberg family and French Banks. The company was initially established to make use of the Birkeland-Eyde process, which utilized electrical arcs for the production of nitrate components (for making fertilizers). The Birkeland-Eyde process was very energy intensive (which not few of Hydro's later industrial ventures would also turn out to be), and thus required cheap power. Luckily, Norwegian Hydroelectric power was getting abundant by then. Nevertheless this meant the process did not do too well elsewhere in the world, and eventually the company switched to less energy intensive methods. In 1927 the switch was made to the Haber-Bosch process in cooperation with the chemical giant IG Farben.\n\nNorsk Hydro's facilities in Rjukan and Notodden now produced liquid ammonia, which was then transported to their new facilities at Herøya for production of Calcium Nitrate, which thus became known as Norwegian saltpeter. Now Norsk Hydro is expanding into new fields; in 1934 the world's first commercial heavy water facility was built at Vemork, producing industrial quantities of this new commodity.\n
NOR_christiania_spigerverk코0=Christiania Spigerverk
NOR_christiania_spigerverk_desc코0=\"Christiania Spiger- og Valtse Værk\", as it was originally called, was a local nail foundry established in the Norwegian capital in 1853. Originally the foundry utilized imported iron, then moved on to using scraps of iron from around the country, and finally they ended up with the groundbreaking Coates-machines for hot-forging nails as opposed to cold-forging them. The innovative and efficient production methods allowed the local foundry to become a large and respected factory in a matter of less than three decades.\n\nWith expanded markets, the Oslo-based factory eventually began producing tools and other iron-based goods as well. During the Great War and the 1920s they even expanded their operations with domestic smelters.\n

NOR_fredrik_wedel_jarlsberg코0=Fredrik Wedel Jarlsberg
NOR_fredrik_wedel_jarlsberg_desc코0=Fredrik \"Fritz\" H. H. Wedel Jarlsberg is a Norwegian aristocrat, jurist and diplomat. He was one of the few Norwegians with extensive knowledge of international relations at the time of the Norwegian declaration of independence in 1905. He then favoured Norway being ruled by a King instead of a President back when the choice came up with Norway's new Independence, as it was a much safer and more diplomatic choice.\n\nWedel Jarlsberg himself belongs to a famous Norwegian and Danish Noble family, and as an aristocrat himself, he holds the title of Baron from his holdings in Denmark. In Norway, however, he holds no such formal titles, as aristocracy was discontinued with the Nobility Law of 1821. As a skilled diplomat, Wedel played a central role in the Norwegian aquisition of the Svalbard archipelago. The islands were awarded to Norway (partly) as compensation for the losses suffered by the neutral Kingdom's Merchant Marine, as it provided subtle help to the Entente during the Great War.

naw_norway.3.d코0=[From.GetName] somehow felt it was in their best interest to stay away from our brilliant idea for companionship.
naw_norway.3.a코0=Maybe another time then...

naw_norway.4.t코0=The Proposal for four year terms passes
naw_norway.4.d코0=The Norwegian Parliament has recently decided that from now on, Norwegian Parliamentary elections will be held every fourth year instead of every third, effective immediately. It is probably their hope that a sitting Government will get more done in one additional year. Of course, it shouldn't be denied that one additional year of job security might be a pleasant side effect for our representatives.
naw_norway.4.a코0=Very well then
naw_norway.4.b코0=Heh, those sly bastards
naw_norway.4.c코0=Now back to the 'samnorsk' debate...

naw_norway.5.t코0=[From.GetName] passes the Proposal for four year terms
naw_norway.5.d코0=The Parliamentary representatives of [From.GetName] have recently passed a proposal to increase their terms from three years to four years, effective immediately. No doubt they are hoping a sitting Government will be able to accomplish more with the additional year. The motion passed without issues.
naw_norway.5.a코0=Okay then
naw_norway.5.b코0=I have no strong feelings one way or the other
naw_norway.5.c코0=Norwegian politics? Bah!

naw_norway.7.t코0=Norway motions for a Nordic Research Collaboration
naw_norway.7.d코0=Our neighbour has invited us to a joint Nordic Research Collaboration, arguing it will lead to the betterment and benefit of all the nations of Scandinavia. Getting a hand on our neighbors' advancements could only do us good. The question is, can we see any downsides to them having access to ours?
naw_norway.7.a코0=More technological advancements in Scandinavian hands would be good for us!
naw_norway.7.b코0=A research collaboration sounds beneficial. Why wouldn't we lend them our chemists periodically?
naw_norway.7.c코0=Our technological advancements in foreign hands? Sounds a tad too risky...

naw_norway.8.t코0=[From.GetName] has joined the Nordic Research Collaboration
naw_norway.8.d코0=[From.GetName] wisely chose to join our Research Collaboration.
naw_norway.8.a코0=And with this, we'll all get wiser still.

naw_norway.9.t코0=[From.GetName] refuses to join the Nordic Research Collaboration
naw_norway.9.d코0=[From.GetName] seems to be more protective of their technology than we had anticipated.
naw_norway.9.a코0=We expected better from them.

naw_norway.10.t코0=An invitation to the Nordic Research Collaboration
naw_norway.10.d코0=Norway has sent us an invitation to the Nordic Research Collaboration, an agreement they say will mutually benefit all of the Nordic countries through the exchange of technological developments.

naw_norway.10.c코0=A nice motion, but we cannot risk our technology falling into the wrong hands.

naw_norway.11.t코0=[From.GetName] has joined the Nordic Research Collaboration
naw_norway.11.d코0=[From.GetName] wisely chose to join our Research Collaboration.

naw_norway.13.d코0=The Scandinavian nation across the Sea wants to sign a research collaboration with the Commonwealth nations. Their scientists will work closely with ours and share their advancements.
naw_norway.13.a코0=A technological exchange would be mutually beneficial.
naw_norway.13.b코0=Collaborating with our friends is only right.
naw_norway.13.c코0=It would be too one sided. Why would we trade aces for treys?

naw_norway.14.t코0=[From.GetName] has agreed to set up a Research Agreement
naw_norway.14.d코0=[From.GetName] has kindly set up a Research Agreement and invited our scientists to partake, contribute and learn.
naw_norway.14.a코0=Cheers.

naw_norway.15.t코0=[From.GetName] refuses our access to the Commonwealth Research
naw_norway.15.d코0=[From.GetName] seems to be protective of their advanced electronics and ships, and has refused us access to Commonwealth research.
naw_norway.15.a코0=The bleedin' buggers.

naw_norway.16.t코0=Norway wants to collaborate with Axis scientists
naw_norway.16.d코0=Our North Germanic friends wants to sign a research collaboration between the Axis nations. Their scientists will work closely with ours and share their advancements.
naw_norway.16.a코0=A technological exchange would be mutually beneficial.
naw_norway.16.b코0=Collaborating with our friends is only right.
naw_norway.16.c코0=Nein. They'll have to settle for leasing or licensing our equipment.

naw_norway.17.t코0=[From.GetName] has agreed to set up a Research Agreement
naw_norway.17.d코0=[From.GetName] has kindly set up a Research Agreement and invited our scientists to partake, contribute and learn.
naw_norway.17.a코0=Danke schön.

naw_norway.18.t코0=[From.GetName] refuses our access to the Axis Research

naw_norway.19.t코0=Norway wants to collaborate with Comintern scientists
naw_norway.19.d코0=Our socialist comrades to the west want to sign a research collaboration between our nations. Their scientists will work closely with ours and share their advancements.
naw_norway.19.a코0=A technological exchange would be mutually beneficial.
naw_norway.19.b코0=Collaborating with our friends is only right.
naw_norway.19.c코0=Nyet. We can't be too careful these days.

naw_norway.20.t코0=[From.GetName] has agreed to set up a Research Agreement
naw_norway.20.d코0=[From.GetName] has kindly set up a Research Agreement and invited our scientists to partake, contribute and learn.
naw_norway.20.a코0=We did right to have faith in our Comrades.

naw_norway.21.a코0=Be what will be.

naw_norway.22.t코0=Norway invites us to the Brotherhood of Democratic Nations
naw_norway.22.d코0=The Norwegians and their allies, up until recently known collectively as the Three Brothers Alliance, the Four Brothers Alliance, or the Nordic Brotherhood depending on who you ask, have recently invited us to join their newly rebranded alliance. No doubt they hope to keep their diplomatic momentum going, and this alliance could be good for our own safety and political influence, but it would also mean committing to our potential new friends.
naw_norway.22.a코0=We are Brothers!
naw_norway.22.b코0=I think we'll keep it at the friendly acquaintance level
naw_norway.22.c코0=We are Brothers, and brothers must be prioritized over our current friends
naw_norway.22.p코0=We can't betray our current allies!

naw_norway.23.t코0=[From.GetName] joins the Brotherhood of Democratic Nations
naw_norway.23.d코0=Our Brother [From.GetName] joined our Brotherhood. Let our peoples stand together for victory.
naw_norway.23.a코0=We are many, yet we are one!

naw_norway.24.t코0=[From.GetName] refuses our gracious hand
naw_norway.24.d코0=[From.GetName] somehow felt it was in their best interest to stay out of our Brotherhood of cordial, powerful and freedom-loving nations. Who knows what they were thinking?
naw_norway.24.a코0=Disappointing...

naw_norway.25.t코0=[From.GetName] has rebranded our faction the Democratic Brotherhood of Nations
naw_norway.25.d코0=Wanting to expand the faction more might require a namechange to something more encompassing.
naw_norway.25.a코0=A new worldwide focus might indeed be needed.

naw_norway.26.t코0=[From.GetName] demands Petsamo
naw_norway.26.d코0=Our neighbour, [From.GetName], has staked their old claims to the Kola peninsula, and so would like a contiguous border to the predominantly Russian inhabited peninsula. To achieve this they've demanded we cede our northernmost territory, Petsamo, to them. While it is sparsely populated, it does contain valuable nickel deposits, and it remains our only outlet into the Barents Sea. What course of action should we take?
naw_norway.26.a코0=Relinquish Petsamo. Let them poke the bear if they so desire...
naw_norway.26.b코0=Let our friends have it, but we expect to be compensated.
naw_norway.26.c코0=Petsamo belongs to the Finns.

naw_norway.27.t코0=[From.GetName] cedes ownership of Petsamo
naw_norway.27.d코0=The Finns have wisely ceded us ownership of the sparsely populated, yet resource rich region of Petsamo. With this we now have a contiguous border to our old medieval claims. This is proof of our nation's high standing in Europe, and of the savviness of our diplomats and statesmen.
naw_norway.27.a코0=Glory to Norway, and cheers to our statesmen!

naw_norway.28.t코0=[From.GetName] refuses our demands for Petsamo
naw_norway.28.d코0=The Finns state that the nature and extent of their borders are non-negotiable, and thus they they will not cede Petsamo to us, whatever our reasons for claiming it may have been. It seems it was in their nature and extent to disappoint us... A formal complaint note has been sent to them, but for the time being we will have to accept their decision.
naw_norway.28.a코0=Did the note mention how much they disappointed us?

naw_norway.29.t코0=[From.GetName] demands we submit to the Revolution
naw_norway.29.d코0=The Norwegians, having recently defeated the Danes and Swedes, now demand we submit to their rule and their communist ideals. With their control over Scandinavia, their increasingly large army and their ties to the Soviets, denying them could be very dangerous. On the other hand, our independence could be at stake with either choice...
naw_norway.29.a코0=We have to submit, with enemies on both sides there's just no other choice...
naw_norway.29.b코0=We have to submit, with enemies on both sides there's just no other choice...
naw_norway.29.c코0=The Norwegians have tightened their control on our nation.
naw_norway.29.p코0=The Norwegians have tightened their control on our nation.
naw_norway.29.e코0=This is where we make our stand, independent Finland is here to stay.

naw_norway.30.t코0=[From.GetName] submits to us
naw_norway.30.d코0=The Finnish have decided to leave us in control of much of their state affairs. With this, the Nordic nations are all ours to lead.
naw_norway.30.a코0=Great.

naw_norway.31.t코0=[From.GetName] refuses to submit to us
naw_norway.31.d코0=The Finnish have decided to refuse our generous offer of submitting to us and keeping their autonomy. Apparently they'd rather be partitioned between us and the Soviets, and apparently hard liquors are way too easy to come by for Finnish statesmen. Now it is our turn to decide; is spreading the revolution to the Finnish people worth a war?
naw_norway.31.a코0=To war.
naw_norway.31.b코0=Or not to war?

naw_norway.32.t코0=[From.GetName] sides with Germany after promising Slesvig to us
naw_norway.32.d코0=The Norwegian leaders have decided to side with Germany to dissuade attacks by them. Naturally many Danes are now upset as we gave up our islands in the North Atlantic in exchange for support to retake all of Slesvig, and maybe Holsten too. And what is more, if Germany defeats the other major powers, how will we be able to defend against them then? We're even on their border... At the very least we could issue our complaints to the Norwegians to satisfy our public and maybe get something out of it?
naw_norway.32.a코0=Issue our complaints to the Norwegian Government.
naw_norway.32.b코0=Refrain from complaining, at least we have peace now.

naw_norway.33.t코0=[From.GetName] understands our decision to side with Germany
naw_norway.33.d코0=The Danes, while upset because we promised them help with retaking Slesvig, understands our pragmatism in siding with Germany, immediate safety must be prioritized. And who knows, if Germany starts losing the war, the friendship with them might not have to last...
naw_norway.33.a코0=[From.GetName] understands our pragmatism.

naw_norway.34.t코0=[From.GetName] issues complaints against us taking sides with Germany
naw_norway.34.d코0=The Danish leaders seemed pretty miffed that we sided with Germany. First there's the issue of how we promised to help reclaiming Slesvig, then there's the fact that the Germans might come for us and the current Danish part of Slesvig if they grow stronger, despite us taking sides. How shall we deal with this?
naw_norway.34.a코0=They must be compensated! Monetary compensation and Greenland as a collateral.
naw_norway.34.b코0=Relinquish Greenland back to them as a collateral for now.
naw_norway.34.c코0=The fools! Do they not understand that we had to do this? They get nothing.

naw_norway.35.t코0=The Norwegians agree to massive compensations
naw_norway.35.d코0=It would seem the Norwegians have really understood our complaints. They've relinquished Greenland back to us as a temporary collateral, in addition to giving us massive monetary compensation, which we're now redirecting into our industries.
naw_norway.35.a코0=It's only right that they pay up, but thanks.

naw_norway.36.t코0=The Norwegians hand over Greenland
naw_norway.36.d코0=For the time being the Norwegians have handed Greenland back to us as a collateral until the rest of Slesvig is ours. We didn't win the Greenland case for nothing! And our public is soothed for now.
naw_norway.36.a코0=Acceptable.

naw_norway.37.t코0=The Norwegians have denied us compensation
naw_norway.37.d코0=Claiming they did what was necessary, the Norwegians have denied us compensation, saying siding with Germany was necessary for the survival of all our nations. This will not be easy to smooth over for us, but such a move and their lacking will to compromise have surely damaged the Norwegian politicians' credibility even more.
naw_norway.37.a코0=This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals.

naw_norway.38.t코0=Upholding our end of the bargain
naw_norway.38.d코0=Slesvig-Holsten is ours, and the Norwegians have upheld their end of the bargain. Measures are now being taken to hand Greenland back to them once more, as was our part of the deal.
naw_norway.38.a코0=Take good care of the Inuit, now!

naw_norway.39.t코0=[From.GetName] has handed Greenland back to us
naw_norway.39.d코0=The Danes, recognizing that our end of the bargain with helping them reclaim Slesvig has been fulfilled, have handed Greenland back to us once more. No longer a temporary collateral, Greenland is now part of the Norwegian Kingdom, and the Inuit will become Norwegian citizens.
naw_norway.39.a코0=Wonderful. How often do you see a string of events with a moral to it?

naw_norway.40.t코0=[From.GetName] sides with the Russians after promising Karelia to us
naw_norway.40.d코0=The Norwegian leaders have decided to side with the Russians to dissuade attacks by them. Naturally some Finns are now upset that we gave up our islands in the Baltic in exchange for support to retake Karelia and end the eastern threat. And what is more, if the Russians defeat the other major powers, how will we be able to defend against them then? We share a huge border with them! At the very least we could issue our complaints to the Norwegians to satisfy our public and maybe get something out of it?
naw_norway.40.a코0=Issue our complaints to the Norwegian Government.
naw_norway.40.b코0=Refrain from complaining, at least we have peace now.

naw_norway.41.t코0=[From.GetName] understands our decision to side with Russia
naw_norway.41.d코0=The Finns, while upset because we promised them help with retaking Karelia, but probably more so because we sided with a threat that may one day come for them, understands our pragmatism in siding with Russia. While worried for the long term, they recognize that immediate safety must be prioritized. And who knows, if Russia starts losing the war, the friendship with them might not have to last...
naw_norway.41.a코0=[From.GetName] understands our pragmatism.

naw_norway.42.t코0=[From.GetName] issues complaints against us taking sides with the Soviet Union
naw_norway.42.d코0=The Finnish leaders seemed pretty miffed that we sided with the Russians. First there's the issue of how we promised to help reclaiming the rest of Karelia, then there's the fact that the Soviets might come for us and Finland if they grow stronger, despite us taking their side. That's the belief of the Finns anyway. How shall we deal with this?
naw_norway.42.a코0=They must be compensated! Give them monetary compensation.
naw_norway.42.b코0=We can't compensate them now, we need our resources to build up our own defenses.

naw_norway.43.t코0=The Norwegians agree to compensations
naw_norway.43.d코0=It would seem the Norwegians have understood our complaints. They're going to give us monetary compensation, which we'll redirect into our industries.
naw_norway.43.a코0=That'll do for now, thanks.

naw_norway.44.t코0=The Norwegians have denied us compensation
naw_norway.44.d코0=Claiming they did what was necessary, the Norwegians have denied us compensation, saying siding with the Soviets was necessary for the survival of all our nations. While expansion into Karelia is one thing, protecting our borders from the Russians in the long run is the main concern here, and that the Norwegians with their cushy position far from the threat won't even compensate us is extremely diappointing...
naw_norway.44.a코0=The sheltered, naive fools...

naw_norway.45.t코0=Motion of No Confidence - Who shall lead the new Government?
naw_norway.45.d코0=The old Government has been thrown out by the Motion of No Confidence, and a new Government will be reinstated, a coalition led by Høyre, our conservative party. However, while the finer details are being ironed out, we will need to make a decision about who should be Prime Minister of Norway. It's come down to two good choices now.
naw_norway.45.a코0=Ivar Lykke - He has relevant experience and the ability to compromise when needed.
naw_norway.45.b코0=C.J. Hambro - He wants the job, and has varied experience in politics and writing.

naw_norway.50.t코0=[From.GetName] proposes a Deal
naw_norway.50.d코0=After Norway was separated from the Danish Kingdom in 1814, the treaty of Kiel gave us possession of their former North Atlantic islands, Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroes. While there has been disagreements on this with the temporary occupation of eastern Greenland by Norwegian irredentists, the Norwegians have now come to us diplomatically, albeit with different demands.\n\nIn return for transferring their former islands of the Faroes and Iceland back to them, the Norwegians will drop their claims on Greenland, defend us in the case of an attack from the Germans, and also help negotiate the return of Slesvig and parts of Holsten should the opportunity arrise. While the demands are quite extensive, the North Atlantic Islands are not the most economically important area of our country, and a return of Slesvig would have proven much more profitable. Should we accept or reject this proposal, or mayhaps propose a compromise, seeing the demands are quite extensive?
naw_norway.50.a코0=Accept, and throw in Greenland as well. We should befriend our kindred people in the North at any cost!
naw_norway.50.b코0=Accept. The islands were Norwegian, and Slesvig-Holsten would be of more value to us.
naw_norway.50.c코0=Negotiate to keep Iceland. The deal is very much in Norway's favour currently.
naw_norway.50.e코0=Refuse such a deal, only the Norwegians would see immediate benefit here...

naw_norway.51.t코0=[From.GetName] accepts the Deal
naw_norway.51.d코0=The proposed Dano-Norwegian deal has been accepted by [From.GetName], and our old islands are now back under our control. Should we ever be in a position to return Slesvig to Denmark we will have to do so to fulfill our end of the bargain.
naw_norway.51.a코0=The Danes truly are good allies, helping us part of the unjust treaty of Kiel.

naw_norway.52.t코0=[From.GetName] accepts the Deal, with a catch
naw_norway.52.d코0=While the Danes liked the general idea of the deal, they unsurprisingly found it a little too one side, seeing as we're the only ones who see immediate gains from it. They've thus proposed a seemingly reasonable counteroffer where the deal is modified so they keep Iceland. Our foreign dignitaries found this reasonable enough and accepted the modified deal.
naw_norway.52.a코0=Not perfect, but perfectly acceptable.

naw_norway.53.t코0=[From.GetName] rejects the Deal
naw_norway.53.d코0=Citing no immediate gains for [From.GetName] and excessive demands from us, the Danes have rejected our plea to reaquire our islands for support in retaking Slesvig-Holsten. While this is a significant setback for our diplomatic path to increased influence, we play this the risky way and instigate revolts on Iceland and the Faroes, seeing as the inhabitants were originally from the Norwegian mainland and part of our Kingdom. This would risk our alliance with Denmark though, and if Denmark doesn't back down, war may break out...
naw_norway.53.a코0=We won't risk our friendship with Denmark. Let them keep the islands...
naw_norway.53.b코0=This is unacceptable. Instigate the revolts and make our demands clear!

naw_norway.54.t코0=[From.GetName] incites secessions on the Islands!
naw_norway.54.d코0=The dastardly Norwegians did not accept us keeping the islands, and have instigated secessionist revolts on Iceland and the Faroes. Utilizing the growing nationalist and autonomy movements on the islands, as well as their common cultural and ethnic ties, the Norwegians have sent troublemakers to the Islands and had them join their country. Greenland remains safe as the inhabitants there do not have such extensive ties to Norway, but we need to take a stance here. Should we accept the previous deal, accept status quo, or leave the alliance and take back our islands by force?
naw_norway.54.a코0=Toss in Greenland as well, we might as well save the initial deal and have them support in retaking Slesvig.
naw_norway.54.b코0=Don't risk anything. Accept the new status quo without support for retaking Slesvig.
naw_norway.54.c코0=Infringing on our territory like this must never be tolerated. To war!

naw_norway.55.t코0=[From.GetName] folds and hands over Greenland
naw_norway.55.d코0=The revolt instigations have been a total success. The Danes have folded to salvage the intial deal, not wanting to risk war, and seeing as the supply lines to Greenland were to long to be worth maintaining. Since the intial deal was pretty largely in our favour, we should forgive their transgressions and support their right to Slesvig if it's ever a relevant issue.
naw_norway.55.a코0=And the Iceland gambit pays off.

naw_norway.56.t코0=[From.GetName] begrudingly accepts the new status quo
naw_norway.56.d코0=The Danes, though bitter over our dirty play, accept the new status quo and staying in the alliance, as long as their supply ships to Greenland still get to dock on the Faroes and Iceland. In addition, there will no longer be any obligation to support their claims on Slesvig if we so desire.
naw_norway.56.a코0=Getting something for nothing? What world class statesmen we have.

naw_norway.57.t코0=[From.GetName] declares War on us!
naw_norway.57.d코0=The Iceland gambit has backfired in the worst possible way! Citing the island revolts as unlawful Norwegian meddling, the Danes have declared it an act of war and have subsequently mobilized their forces against us and declared war. The only positive in this is that the Danes took the first offensive moves, and this could potentially help convince other allied states to join our defense against the Danish.
naw_norway.57.a코0=Sometimes you get more than you bargain for. The Danes have now forced our hand...

naw_norway.58.t코0=[From.GetName] accepts the Deal, and then some!
naw_norway.58.d코0=The proposed Dano-Norwegian deal has been accepted by [From.GetName], and our old islands, including Greenland which was tossed into the deal in good faith, are now back under our control. Should we ever be in a position to return Slesvig to Denmark we will have to do so to fulfill our end of the bargain.
naw_norway.58.a코0=The Danes truly are good allies, helping us undo the damage from the unjust treaty of Kiel.

naw_norway.59.t코0=The Fennoscandian Deal
naw_norway.59.d코0=Fearing incursions into the eastern borders of their alliance, the Fennoscandian allies, Norway, Sweden and Finland, have reached an understanding towards mutual defensive guarantees. Finland transferred the majority Swedish inhabited Åland islands to Sweden, while Sweden transferred the former Norwegian territory of Båhuslen to Norway.\n\nWith this, Norway, the country least directly threatened by eventual Russian expansionism was given insentive to defend their allies closer to the danger, Sweden got to limit the potential expansion of their former enemy, and Finland now have neighbors pledging to defend their eastern borders, including the all-important Karelian isthmus.
naw_norway.59.a코0=Friends can always reach an understanding. Now to make our military a proper part of the deterrent
naw_norway.59.b코0=Don't they trust us? In any case, we should be wary of these scheming neighbors...

naw_norway.60.t코0=Haakon VII abdicates
naw_norway.60.d코0=Facing increasing radical tensions within Norway, King Haakon, himself a respected and democratically inclined man, has decided to bow for the increasing pressure calling for a new kind of hierarchy in the state. His abdication was effective immediately.
naw_norway.60.a코0=However good a King he was, Monarchy is outdated
naw_norway.60.b코0=What is going on with our friends?
naw_norway.60.c코0=Monarchy is redundant to the People
naw_norway.60.p코0=Radical politics must be at work in Norway...

naw_norway.61.t코0=[From.GetName] offers Terms
naw_norway.61.d코0=Facing the onslaught of our War Machine, the [From.GetAdjective] Leadership has decided to seek peace with us, and in turn they offer to become our satellite state. This will lead to peace between our nations, and as they become our subject state they will join any ongoing wars of ours on our side. What do we make of this?
naw_norway.61.a코0=Accept ruling [From.GetName] indirectly
naw_norway.61.b코0=Only total annexation of their country is good enough...

naw_norway.62.t코0=[From.GetName] accepts our Terms
naw_norway.62.d코0=[From.GetName] has accepted our terms of surrender, and we shall henceforth be a satellite state of theirs. This also means we have no choice but to participate in any conflicts they may drag us into for the time being. But maybe there's freedom and peace on the distant horizon?
naw_norway.62.a코0=Unfortunately, we had ran out of other options...

naw_norway.63.t코0=[From.GetName] rejects our Terms
naw_norway.63.d코0=[From.GetName] has rejected our terms of surrender, seemingly having decided that only direct rule is good enough. This might turn into a fight for our very independence and existence!
naw_norway.63.a코0=So a fight is unavoidable, and the stakes are raised...

naw_norway.64.t코0=The Nationalist Faction of [Root.GetNameDef]
naw_norway.64.d코0=Indeed steps are being taken to project our stance and values toward the world. A new faction could see the light of dawn after the hard work of our representatives and statesmen. What should we call our new and strong alliance?
naw_norway.64.a코0=\"Northern Lights\", we shall shine our lights upon the envious world.
naw_norway.64.b코0=\"Nordic Assembly\", because under our leadership the best is sure to assemble.
naw_norway.64.c코0=\"Pact of Stone\", for we are first and foremost unshakeable, like our Mountains.
naw_norway.64.p코0=Hmmm... Let me see the other options, please...

naw_norway.65.t코0=The Nationalist Faction of [Root.GetNameDef]
naw_norway.65.d코0=Indeed steps are being taken to project our stance and values toward the world. A new faction could see the light of dawn after the hard work of our representatives and statesmen. What should we call our new and strong alliance?
naw_norway.65.a코0=\"Northern Realm\", simple, descriptive, quaint.
naw_norway.65.b코0=\"Nordic Union\", for what is an alliance but kindred nations.
naw_norway.65.c코0=Let's take this from the start again.
naw_norway.65.p코0=Let's not make this choice right now.

naw_norway.70.t코0=Old Traditions Rekindled
naw_norway.70.d코0=The Old Traditions of [Root.GetName] has recently seen a romantic revival, with people and politicians now questioning whether old traditions such as aristocratic titles should be brought back (though with our democratic traditions, most agree the titles should come without the privileges this time). Some even argue for bringing back old place names and even the old flag of the medieval Kingdom of Norway. Which course of action should we take?
naw_norway.70.a코0=Aristocracy is outdated, and we should of course stick to our current Norwegian flag.
naw_norway.70.b코0=Aristocratic titles for our most upstanding citizens, but keep our current flag.
naw_norway.70.c코0=We must respect our traditions! We shall have aristocracy AND our glorious old flag.

naw_norway.71.t코0=The Location of Power
naw_norway.71.d코0=In the past [Root.GetNameDef] has had many different capitals, but the main three remain Oslo, Bergen (formerly known as Bjørgvin) and Trondheim (formerly known as Nidaros). With the rapid changes towards our traditional Kingdom, we now also have a chance to make one of the older cities the capital again, should we so wish. Though, Oslo is still the biggest city, close to most of our agriculture and containing most of our institutions, so the move might not prove popular around there...
naw_norway.71.a코0=Stick with Oslo as capital.
naw_norway.71.b코0=Go with Bergen, former capital and an important trading city.
naw_norway.71.c코0=Go with Trondheim, former capital and an important spot for pilgrims and religion.

naw_norway.72.t코0=City names of Old?
naw_norway.72.d코0=With key symbolic issues decided upon, it might be time to consider if we should reinstate old placenames, specifically for our cities. Should we stick with what the current generations know, rename our biggest cities, or even start with renaming all the big cities and several of the smaller ones to really bring about some change?
naw_norway.72.a코0=Leave it. The most important thing is that there's no Christiania.
naw_norway.72.b코0=Rename the major cities. Bjørgvin and Nidaros shall be brought back.
naw_norway.72.c코0=Major rebranding is needed. Start with Bergen, Trondheim, Aalesund and Hamar.

naw_norway.73.t코0=The Monarchist Coalition
naw_norway.73.d코0=Now that the Monarchist Coalition is in power, who should lead it in its initial steps to shape our Kingdom? Our oldest political party, the Liberal Party? Our pro-tradition Agrarian Party? Or maybe the Conservatives?
naw_norway.73.a코0=The Liberal Party.
naw_norway.73.b코0=The Farmers' Party.
naw_norway.73.c코0=The Conservative Party.

naw_norway.74.t코0=The Extent of Power
naw_norway.74.d코0=With the revival of old traditions, politicians and supporters of the new, yet old, state has questioned just how it's supposed to be run. With the Prime Minister answering to the King for all intents, or still retaining many Parliamentary powers? How often should elections be held? How much power should the King have in this reshaped Kingdom, specifically?
naw_norway.74.a코0=Elections as usual, and a traditional, yet Constitutional Monarchy.
naw_norway.74.b코0=More power to the King. Still, a Constitutional Monarchy with elections.
naw_norway.74.c코0=The Prime Minister should answer to the King, but elections should still be held.
naw_norway.74.p코0=The King shall have widespread power, a true traditional Monarchy.

naw_norway.75.t코0=Traditions worth fighting for?
naw_norway.75.d코0=With the wave of Monarchism washing over our country, many people have flocked to our Monarchist ranks. Should we seize the moment with force, or should we wait for people to come around to our wholesome point of view?
naw_norway.75.a코0=We fight at dawn!
naw_norway.75.b코0=Eh, maybe at dawn in say, a month. We need to prepare.
naw_norway.75.c코0=The King wouldn't like it if we started a war for his sake. We'll convice them in time.

naw_norway.76.t코0=Prepared to fight?
naw_norway.76.d코0=It's been a month since our Monarchist supporters first met. Is this the moment to strike, risking a civil war?
naw_norway.76.a코0=We're ready. To war!
naw_norway.76.b코0=Maybe this wasn't such a good idea in the end..

naw_norway.77.t코0=Norway invites us to their Alliance
naw_norway.77.d코0=In the national anthem of Norway, sixth verse, there's a part about how the Scandinavians shall stand together in wars. The Norwegians are now reviving the Pan-Scandinavianism (or Pan-Nordic) movement, and they are reaching out to us.
naw_norway.77.a코0=Brother Kingdoms in life and death!
naw_norway.77.b코0=Maybe not in death...

naw_norway.78.t코0=[From.GetName] joins [Root.GetFactionName]
naw_norway.78.d코0=Our Brother [From.GetName] joined our faction. Let our Peoples stand Together for Victory!
naw_norway.78.a코0=A few more quality cards and we'll have ourselves a royal flush.

naw_norway.79.t코0=[From.GetName] refuses our hand
naw_norway.79.d코0=[From.GetName] somehow felt it was in their best interest to refuse our tradition based alliance.
naw_norway.79.a코0=A royal fiasco...

naw_norway.80.t코0=The Faroe Islands Reintegrated
naw_norway.80.d코0=Having rekindled our connection to our kinsmen on the Faroes, they now feel welcome and strive to integrate into their past nation of origin. [Root.GetName] welcomes them home. Now, how shall we name the islands now within our country?
naw_norway.80.a코0=With bokmål, the written language of the majority.
naw_norway.80.b코0=With nynorsk, the current written language closest to spoken dialects and old Norwegian.
naw_norway.80.c코0=Let's use the language of the native Faroese people to name their islands.

naw_norway.81.t코0=Iceland Reintegrated
naw_norway.81.d코0=Fate has once again brought us together with the Isle of Viking Sagas. Originally Norwegians fleeing the rule and taxes of our first King, and later brought back into the Norwegian Kingdom, the Danish Union and treaty of Kiel once took Iceland away from us along with the Faroes and Greenland. Our similar culture, history and ancestry now bring us together once more.
naw_norway.81.a코0=Another event worthy of a Saga.

naw_norway.82.t코0=Greenland Reintegrated
naw_norway.82.d코0=While the original Norwegian-Icelandic settlers on Greenland died out, Greenland was brought back into the Norwegian fold by a Dano-Norwegian mission which reached the island in the 1720s. The treaty of Kiel took this island away from us, with us having little say in the matter. And the Greenland case did not work out well for us either... Now, however, fate has brought it back to us. While the new settlers of this island, the Inuit people, have been Christened and integrated, they're not originally of Norwegian ancestry like the Faroese and Icelandic peoples, so integration has naturally been harder here. But now, finally, the Inuit are starting to settle into their new nation.
naw_norway.82.a코0=The Greenlanders will do well in our nation.

naw_norway.83.t코0=Båhuslen Reintegrated
naw_norway.83.d코0=Båhuslen was Norwegian land for 800 years before it was lost in one of the many wars between the Danes and Swedes, with us involved due to our union with Denmark. And while it was briefly recaptured, it didn't make the peace treaties. Now though, events have brought it into our ownership once more, and the people of Båhuslen are ready to contribute to their new nation, no doubt our long history and our common heritage helping.
naw_norway.83.a코0=Our numbers grow, as do our coastline.
naw_norway.83.b코0=Our very old, Norwegian coastline.
naw_norway.83.c코0=Very, very old, in fact...

naw_norway.84.t코0=Jamtland Reintegrated
naw_norway.84.d코0=The rough, yet beautiful landscapes of Jamtland, as well as its inhabitants, have been reintegrated into the Norwegian nation. There is however, the question on what we name this new addition to our country, or rather, how we name it. Should we use modern Norwegian written language, or something based on our other less common written language, but which is more traditional, and conforms to both the dialects of the Jamtlanders themselves and our bordering region of Trøndelag? There's also the back to our roots approach where we give it its old norse name.
naw_norway.84.a코0=Let's go with the written language of the majority, the bokmål variant.
naw_norway.84.b코0=Let's stick with traditions and local dialects, the nynorsk variant.
naw_norway.84.c코0=Let's go back to our common roots, the Norse variant.

naw_norway.85.t코0=Orkney Reintegrated
naw_norway.85.d코0=The Orkney islands were once the centerpiece of the Jarldom of Orkney, one of the highest ranking titles one could hold within the Norwegian Kingdom. Now they have surprisingly come under our ownership again. With a mixed heritage of Norwegian, Celtic and Scots, the people of the area have now been integrated into our nation, and they are willing to become citizens. But how shall we name the area now? In a modern way, a traditional way, or a very traditional way?
naw_norway.85.a코0=Modern bokmål will do nicely. With the samnorsk initiatives, it's Norwegian enough.
naw_norway.85.b코0=Nynorsk of course! Language based on how Norwegians speak, not how Danes write.
naw_norway.85.c코0=Let's start things where we left it, with inhabitants speaking the Norse language.

naw_norway.86.t코0=Shetland Reintegrated
naw_norway.86.d코0=The Shetland islands were once part of the Norwegian Jarldom of Orkney, one of the highest ranking titles one could hold within the Norwegian Kingdom. As they have recently come under our ownership again, we've worked on reintegrating these former Norwegian islands into our country again, and now we've seen success. But the question remains; Shetland, or Hjaltland?
naw_norway.86.a코0=Shetland is a nice modern take on the old...
naw_norway.86.b코0=But you can't beat the original, Hjaltland it is!

naw_norway.100.t코0=The Moscow Trials
naw_norway.100.d코0=The Soviet Union has, and still is, going through some large and brutal internal changes. Many people of power and influence have been sentenced during the already infamous Moscow Trials.\n\nWith international press being allowed to attend, what has been noted is that surprising amounts of the people on trial have admitted to very serious crimes within the Union. Could they have been forced or pressured into admitting this? Is the General Secretary attempting to get rid of political opponents?\n\nAs news are brought back to Norway, media and people have speculated on what is going on, and often condemned the trials as unjust and suspect. Many of our political parties are now distancing themselves from the Comintern, and have moderated themselves. How shall we handle these reports from Moscow?
naw_norway.100.a코0=Condemn unjust trials and let our media freely report and inform.
naw_norway.100.b코0=Attempt to cover up the worst parts, the workers need socialism.
naw_norway.100.c코0=Let's use this farce to promote nationalist and anti-communist sentiments.
naw_norway.100.p코0=This is evidence that we need solid traditions to counter extremism.

naw_norway.101.t코0=[From.GetName] pursues closer ties with Germany
naw_norway.101.d코0=[From.GetLeader] has announced that [From.GetName] ought to grow mutually friendly and kindred relations with its Brother People in the German nation. The German ministers are most pleased with this, and in a recent state visit by [From.GetLeader], they agreed to promote mutual cooperation between the two nations.
naw_norway.101.a코0=We have chosen wisely.
naw_norway.101.b코0=What could our neighbors be up to?
naw_norway.101.c코0=Get the schnapps, a toast to our new friends is in order!
naw_norway.101.p코0=The friends of our friends could be our friends as well!
naw_norway.101.e코0=There's some poor judgement going on in northwestern Europe.
naw_norway.101.f코0=Let's take note of this development.

naw_norway.102.t코0=[From.GetName] pursues closer ties with the Soviet Union
naw_norway.102.d코0=\n[From.GetLeader] has announced the friendship and mutual cooperation between [From.GetName] and their Eastern neighbors. No doubt the Norwegians have made a powerful friend, and the Revolution spreads further. The Russian ministers are pleased with this event, and in a recent state visit by [From.GetLeader], mutual goodwill was apparent.
naw_norway.102.a코0=We have chosen wisely.
naw_norway.102.b코0=What could our neighbors be up to?
naw_norway.102.c코0=Get the vodka, a toast to our new friends is in order!
naw_norway.102.p코0=The friends of our friends could be our friends as well!
naw_norway.102.e코0=There's some poor judgement going on in northwestern Europe.
naw_norway.102.f코0=Let's take note of this development.

naw_norway.140.t코0=The Norwegian Civil War
naw_norway.140.d코0=In this age of rapidly shifting political situations, Norway has decided to go a rather different route than countries such as the Soviet Union, Italy and Germany, with their new and unprecedented political ideologies. Indeed in the Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy of Norway many people have argued for a return to traditions, old values and an old fashioned Kingdom. Though this time without rule from Copenhagen or Stockholm.\n\nThe traditional conservative, centrist, agrarian and monarchist elements have now joined forces with much of the Military to attempt to restore such a state. In the capital area, this move has met massive resistance, and volunteers have started pouring in from Europe. The Norwegian Civil War has now undeniably started.
naw_norway.140.a코0=Family and traditions first!
naw_norway.140.b코0=Brotherhood and democracy first!
naw_norway.140.c코0=A neighbouring civil war? We best be careful if Norway can fall into chaos like that...
naw_norway.140.p코0=Fighting for Monarchy? How will this benefit the masses? The Norwegian Monarchists are deluded...
naw_norway.140.e코0=How could this happen in Norway?

naw_norway.141.t코0=The Civil War has ended - Opposition Captured!
naw_norway.141.d코0=Upon capturing Oslo and the last strongholds of our opponents we have captured the leaders of those who took up arms against us. While some argue taking up arms against us and causing the misery of a civil war should be punished, others advocate leniency, as brave souls fighting for what they believe in could be useful for new Kingdom. How shall we deal with these perpetrators?
naw_norway.141.a코0=Widespread penal labor for those who caused people to take up arms!
naw_norway.141.b코0=Penal labor only for the worst of perpetrators.

naw_norway.142.t코0=The Norwegian Civil War has Ended
naw_norway.142.d코0=Upon the capture of Oslo it was only a question of time before the Monarchist forces would have won the civil war in Norway. Monarchist and traditionalist forces have fought to reinstate a traditional monarchy, and with the end of the civil war, the path to reform lays open.\n\nKey opposition members will be tried, and King Haakon, who was against the civil war from the start, has stated that he is glad to see peace return to Norway. Let the healing process begin.
naw_norway.142.a코0=The day is ours!
naw_norway.142.b코0=Good, the Norwegian people will no longer suffer the horrors of war.
naw_norway.142.c코0=Good to know.

naw_norway.145.t코0=Separtists on the Faroes and Iceland
naw_norway.145.d코0=There are new developments in the war between Norway and Denmark. Norwegians in cooperation with key Icelanders and key Faroese people have managed to instigate revolts against Danish rule on the former Norwegian islands. This is sure to set the Danish cause back.
naw_norway.145.a코0=A diplomatic victory, even in war. Our cause is righteous.
naw_norway.145.b코0=This is dirty play, even by being at war standards.
naw_norway.145.c코0=Hmmm... Maybe the Norwegian cause had something going for it after all.

naw_norway.150.t코0=The Monarchist Faction of [Root.GetNameDef]
naw_norway.150.d코0=Indeed steps are being taken to project our stance and values toward the world. A new faction could see the light of dawn after the hard work of our representatives and statesmen. What should we call this new, ambitious alliance?
naw_norway.150.a코0=\"Royal League\", I think. Now if you'll excuse me, I feel like taking a break with some football.
naw_norway.150.b코0=\"Monarchist Union\". Why leave things to people's imagination?
naw_norway.150.c코0=\"Union of Kings\". \"Kings\" in plural is important so the Danes or Swedes don't get any ideas.

naw_norway.151.a코0=\"Kindred Kingdoms\" sounds good. It indeed has a nice ring to it.
naw_norway.151.b코0=\"Northern Realm\", for sure. Geography is underrated.
naw_norway.151.c코0=\"Nordic Union\". It's simple, and leaves room for potential traditonalist republics. Hei Suomi!
naw_norway.151.p코0=Hmmm... Let me see even more options, please...

naw_norway.152.d코0=Indeed steps are being taken to project our stance and values toward the world. A new faction could see the light of dawn after the hard work of our representatives and statesmen. What should we call this new, ambitious alliance?
naw_norway.152.a코0=\"Great Northern Alliance\", for Monarchy does have an element of Grandeur to it.
naw_norway.152.b코0=\"Princely Pact\", simple and elegant.
naw_norway.152.c코0=Let's take this from the start again.
naw_norway.152.p코0=Let's not make this choice right now.

naw_norway.160.t코0=[From.GetName] wants to join forces with the Kaiserreich
naw_norway.160.d코0=[From.GetName] has petitioned us for an alliance. The traditional Kingdom in the North and their subject states will join us if we accept this.
naw_norway.160.a코0=Agree. More friends for the Kaiserreich.
naw_norway.160.b코0=Refuse. We're doing fine as is.

naw_norway.161.t코0=[From.GetName] accepts us into their Alliance
naw_norway.161.d코0=The German Kaiser and his representatives have agreed to let us join their faction. Let's build a better world together.
naw_norway.161.a코0=Those are excellent news.

naw_norway.162.t코0=[From.GetName] rejects us joining their Alliance...
naw_norway.162.d코0=The German Kaiser has turned down our most generous proposal to join forces with them.
naw_norway.162.a코0=Those are disappointing news.

naw_norway.163.t코0=[From.GetName] wants to join forces with the Empire
naw_norway.163.d코0=[From.GetName] has petitioned us for an alliance. The traditional Kingdom in the North and their subject states will join us if we accept this.
naw_norway.163.a코0=Agree. More friends for the Empire.

naw_norway.165.t코0=[From.GetName] rejects us joining their Alliance...
naw_norway.165.d코0=The British King has turned down our most generous proposal to join forces with them.
naw_norway.165.a코0=Those are disappointing news.

naw_norway.170.t코0=[From.GetName] wants some compensation for their help
naw_norway.170.d코0=The Norwegians, having joined forces with us, have now stated they want some compensation for helping defend our Homelands and our Empire. While ours is a powerful alliance of the British Empire and Germany, their help would not go amiss. They've thus requested we give back their old possession, the Shetland islands, as compensation for their efforts.
naw_norway.170.a코0=This seems fair, they shall have the Shetlands.
naw_norway.170.b코0=Let's not part with the islands.

naw_norway.171.t코0=[From.GetName] accepts ceding the Shetlands
naw_norway.171.d코0=The British have found our deal acceptable, and the Shetland islands will be transferred shortly. Maritime borders will be negotiated at a later date.
naw_norway.171.a코0=Thanks a bunch.

naw_norway.172.t코0=[From.GetName] rejects ceding the Shetlands
naw_norway.172.d코0=The British have found our deal somewhat unacceptable, and the Shetland islands will remain theirs for now.
naw_norway.172.a코0=A disappointing bunch.

naw_norway.173.t코0=[From.GetName] wants compensation for their help
naw_norway.173.d코0=The Norwegians, having joined forces with us, have now stated they want some compensation for helping defend our Homelands and our Empire. Specifically they're referring to the Orkney islands and the Shetland islands. Should we agree, negotiate lesser compensation for them, or just outright refuse?
naw_norway.173.a코0=Our friends can have their old islands back!
naw_norway.173.b코0=If we negotiate only to hand over the Shetlands, they'll have to accept eventually.
naw_norway.173.c코0=Reject ceding our islands.

naw_norway.174.t코0=[From.GetName] accepts ceding Shetland and Orkney
naw_norway.174.d코0=The British have found our deal fair enough, and have started the transfer of our old islands. Maritime borders will be negotiated shortly after.
naw_norway.174.a코0=Thank you very much.

naw_norway.175.t코0=[From.GetName] accepts ceding the Shetlands, but not Orkney
naw_norway.175.d코0=The British have found our deal almost acceptable, but they want to retain Orkney. Our foreign dignitaries accepted the deal, being afraid of leaving with nothing. Maritime borders will be negotiated shortly after.
naw_norway.175.a코0=Thank you.

naw_norway.176.t코0=[From.GetName] rejects ceding any of the islands
naw_norway.176.d코0=The British have found our deal unacceptable, wanting to retain all their islands. Our foreign dignitaries have left empty handed.
naw_norway.176.a코0=Thanks for listening...

naw_norway.180.t코0=A joint anti-Bolshevik faction?
naw_norway.180.d코0=Seeing the rising threats towards the old order and traditions, [From.GetNameDef] has invited us to their new faction of monarchist and traditionalist countries. This alliance they claim is meant to stand against political extremism and military aggression from extremist countries, Bolshevism in particular.\n\n Shall we join this faction? Any subject countries would go with us, but eventual other faction members of ours would be free to choose whether to go with us or remain on their own if they won't.
naw_norway.180.a코0=Yes, let this Grand Alliance become reality!
naw_norway.180.b코0=How can the sparsely populated North possibly help us?

naw_norway.181.t코0=[From.GetName] joins the traditionalist alliance
naw_norway.181.d코0=We now welcome our new friends from [From.GetName] into our alliance. This is a great day for our values.
naw_norway.181.a코0=We grow even stronger!

naw_norway.182.t코0=[From.GetName] won't join the traditionalist alliance
naw_norway.182.d코0=[From.GetName] somehow felt it was in their best interest stay their own course, without us.
naw_norway.182.a코0=I guess they weren't up for it.

naw_norway.200.t코0=[From.GetName] declares Armed Neutrality
naw_norway.200.d코0=[From.GetName] has decided it's for the best if the country once more strives for Neutrality like it did back in the Great War. It is the Norwegian Government's hope that this will once more avoid bringing harmful conflict to the Norwegian People's doorstep. The question remains, can [From.GetName] trust the world to respect this neutrality?
naw_norway.200.a코0=So far, no immediate danger seem to threaten them
naw_norway.200.b코0=Will this save [From.GetName] from the regional aggression?
naw_norway.200.c코0=Oh well, an attempt was made...
naw_norway.200.p코0=Hey, if it worked the last time...

naw_norway.201.t코0=[GER.GetName] violated [NOR.GetAdjective] Neutrality!
naw_norway.201.d코0=[GER.GetName] has decided it's in its best interest to avoid having [NOR.GetNameDef] as a neutral neighbour in the coming conflict. Could their distrust stem from the United Kingdom forcing Norway to subtly help them in the latter half of the Great War? Whatever the reason, Norway is now under threat from the industrial power to its south...
naw_norway.201.a코0=Fortunately, we seem to be quite prepared.
naw_norway.201.b코0=At least our forces seem to be somewhat up to the task.
naw_norway.201.c코0=Unfortunately, we don't seem to be quite prepared.
naw_norway.201.p코0=When push comes to shove, the Norwegians would side with our enemies...
naw_norway.201.e코0=It would seem [GER.GetNameDef] did not trust the Norwegians to stay neutral at all...

naw_norway.202.t코0=[ENG.GetName] violated [NOR.GetAdjective] Neutrality!
naw_norway.202.d코0=[ENG.GetName] has decided it's in its best interest to avoid having [NOR.GetNameDef] as a neutral neighbour in the coming conflict. Could the actions of [ENG.GetName] mean they want to cut of German iron supplies from Northern Sweden? Whatever the reason, Norway is now under threat from its neighbour across the North Sea...
naw_norway.202.a코0=Fortunately, we seem to be quite prepared.
naw_norway.202.b코0=At least our forces seem to be somewhat up to the task.
naw_norway.202.c코0=Unfortunately, we don't seem to be quite prepared.
naw_norway.202.p코0=We can not risk them trading with or supplying our enemies. They have to be stopped...
naw_norway.202.e코0=It would seem [ENG.GetNameDef] did not trust the Norwegians to stay neutral at all...

naw_norway.203.t코0=Aggressors have violated [NOR.GetAdjective] Neutrality!
naw_norway.203.d코0=It would seem the enemies of [NOR.GetNameDef] have decided it's in their best interest to avoid having [NOR.GetNameDef] as a neutral country in Northwestern Europe. This has come as a surprise to outside observers, who could only speculate as to why this has happened? Did they not like [NOR.GetNameDef]'s trade with certain nations? Or did they not trust them to stay neutral?
naw_norway.203.a코0=Fortunately, we seem to be quite prepared.
naw_norway.203.b코0=At least our forces seem to be somewhat up to the task.
naw_norway.203.c코0=Unfortunately, we don't seem to be quite prepared.
naw_norway.203.p코0=Onlookers may be perplexed, but for now, only we need to understand our master plan!
naw_norway.203.e코0=What could this be about, for someone to go to such drastic measures all of a sudden?

naw_norway.204.t코0=[From.GetName] petitions to join our Faction
naw_norway.204.d코0=After foreign aggressors broke [From.GetNameDef]'s neutrality, they've now turned to us in hope that we'll accept them into our alliance and stand up to those that would break their neutrality. Should we accept their petition to join us?
naw_norway.204.a코0=Yes. [From.GetName] can trust us to have their back.
naw_norway.204.b코0=No. [From.GetName] is naught but a liability...

naw_norway.205.t코0=[From.GetName] has accepted us joining their Faction
naw_norway.205.d코0=Our friends in [From.GetNameDef] has accepted us into their alliance in our time of need. Our aggressors shall know we have the support of others against their brazen aggression!
naw_norway.205.a코0=True friends indeed answer when called upon.

naw_norway.206.t코0=[From.GetName] has refused us joining their Faction
naw_norway.206.d코0=[From.GetName] somehow felt bailing us out in our time of need would be too much of a hassle...
naw_norway.206.a코0=Guess we're out of luck there... Should we seek help elsewhere?

naw_news.100.t코0=The Fall of Copenhagen
naw_news.100.d코0=Norwegian forces advancing through Sjaelland have succeeded in capturing Copenhagen. \n\nThe now sporadic fighting continues to diminish, and luckily the fierce resistance and artillery shelling had been reduced to small arms skirmishing before the Norwegian forces reached Fredriksstaden with Amalienborg Palace, leaving the rococo architecture mostly undamaged.\n\nCertain Danes intent on continuing the resistance evacuated in the hours before and during the invasion, but the city lies mostly silent as the Norwegians strengthen their hold on the city and populace.\n\nThe Danish struggle against [NOR.GetNameDef] may well continue elsewhere, but the loss of their capital is a surefire blow to Danish governmental and military capabilities.
naw_news.100.a코0=Denmark could not stand up to [NOR.GetNameDef].
naw_news.100.b코0=A glorious victory for the Sons of Norway!
naw_news.100.c코0=As if the Swedes invading Copenhagen wasn't bad enough.

naw_news.101.t코0=The Fall of Stockholm
naw_news.101.d코0=While fighting rages on elsewhere in [SWE.GetNameDef], reports have come in of Norwegian troop detachments entering the Swedish capital.\n\nBoth the Swedish civilians and Norwegian forces seem to be in an eerie mood as this culmination of the unexpected conflict between the two countries is out there in the open. A short victory parade was held by the Norwegian troops after most of the Swedish institutions in Stockholm were secured by the Norwegians. Since the combat quickly diminished into small arms fire, the city is still in surprisingly good condition, though the Old Stockholm telephone tower did partially collapse after taking damage from mortar fire.\n\nSwedish resolve is expected to weaken significantly with these news.
naw_news.101.a코0=[NOR.GetNameDefCap] apparently hits hard for their weight class.
naw_news.101.b코0=Now the balance of power has finally shifted back to western Scandinavia.
naw_news.101.c코0=This is downright unbelivable!

naw_news.102.t코0=The Fall of Helsinki
naw_news.102.d코0=Reports from Southern Finland now confirm that the Finnish capital has been captured by advancing Norwegian troops.\n\nSmall arms fire can still be heard from some boroughs and the outskirts, but no significant Finnish forces have been sighted within the city.\n\nStill, a detachment of Norwegian snipers has taken up positions near the University of Helsinki, limiting the possibilities of Finnish counterattacks in the area anyways. The Finnish Government and other high ranking officials seem to have evacuated before the fighting hit Helsinki as well.
naw_news.102.a코0=The [NOR.GetAdjective] army is on the march
naw_news.102.b코0=The Finns must fall in line now.
naw_news.102.c코0=What do the Norwegians even want here?

####--Leader Descriptions--####
POLITICS_JOHAN_NYGAARDSVOLD_DESC코0=Born a farmer's son in Hommelvik, in what is now Malvik municipality, Johan Nygaardsvold had his first job at a sawmill at 12 years of age. He emigrated to Canada, and later the United States, as a young adult in 1902. There he took jobs in British Columbia, Montana and Washington.\n\nWhen he returned to Norway just five years later, he got into poltics to stay, and in 1910 he was elected to the board of education for the Labour Party, which he would continue to represent. Now he has already made his mark on Norwegian politics, being one of the people behind the so-called \"crisis accord\" with the Farmers' Party, which allowed him to form a Government in 1935, as was asked of him. His Government has been a large proponent of alleviating the effects of the Depression through progressive welfare policies, but maybe not so much of military spending and vigilant foreign policies.
POLITICS_NILS_TRAEDAL_DESC코0=Born a farmer's son in Sunndal, Nils Trædal has had plenty of responsibility and political experience throughout his life. The jobs and leadership roles held in his adult life include working as; a priest, a politician, a former mayor, a former Church and Education minister of both Peder L. Kolstad's Government and Jens Hundeid's Government (1931-1932 and 1932-1933, respectively), an acting Prime Minister/Foreign Minister (early 1932), a Government representative of Møre og Romsdal county, and a former member of the Liberal Party.\n\nHe was also a co-founder of the Farmers' Party's predecessor, and he has now risen to become the party leader of the current Farmers' Party. An advocate for agricultural reform and a man of many talents, Norway can now enjoy the benefits of his varied experience.
POLITICS_IVAR_LYKKE_DESC코0=Born in what was then called Trondhjem, Ivar Lykke was the son of a grocer and businessman. After he had worked in his father's business, his introduction to politics first came as he represented the trade industries in local politics. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1916, and was noted as a moderate and sober politician, representing the interests of practical businesses.\n\nHis acceptance of social liberal reforms, as well as his pleasant and humble demeanor, earned him much trust throughout the years. He turned down his first opportunity to become Prime Minister, but in 1926 his namesake Government formed, and this time with him as the Prime Minister of Norway. After this he has continued his work in politics, an example being the naming dispute of his home city, Trondhjem. The question was of whether it was to still be called Trondhjem or reverted to old Norwegian Nidaros. In March of 1931 it ended on Lykke's compromise suggestion, Trondheim.
POLITICS_CARL_JOACHIM_HAMBRO_DESC코0=Born in 1885, and a native to Bergen, for most of his adult life he's been a journalist and an editor-in-chief for Morgenbladet (the country's first daily newspaper). Unsurprisingly he's also a skilled rhetorician, and since 1919 he's been an elected offical to Norway's National Assembly and Supreme Legislature, Stortinget. Since then he's held important positions such as the Parliamentary Leader of Høyre, President of the Storting and Vice President of the Storting.\n\nA merited man, having been awarded the Grand Cross of St. Olav's Order in 1937, and a knowledgable man, on literature both old and new, Hambro can get things done right (and swiftly when needed).
POLITICS_JOHAN_LUDWIG_MOWINCKEL_DESC코0=Johan Ludwig Mowinckel was born in Bergen in 1870, born into one of Norway's oldest shopkeeping families. He studied language and business abroad, in Germany, England and France. He bought his first boat in 1898, and ran a shipping company in his own name. Shortly thereafter he got into the city council of Bergen, and he was the mayor during the dissolution of the Union between Norway and Sweden. In 1907 he took office in the Norwegian Parliament for the first time.\n\nSince then Johan L. Mowinckel would later go on to be part of several Governments, serving as Prime Minister thrice, and often holding other important positions such as President of the Storting (the Norwegian Parliament), Minister of Industry, Minister of Commerce, and Foreign Minister, among other postitions. He's truly an important figure in Norwegian politics.
POLITICS_HAAKON_VII_DESC코0=King Haakon VII was actually born Christian Frederik Carl Georg Valdemar Axel, prince of Denmark and Iceland, in 1872. In his younger life he served in the Danish Navy, from 1893 with the rank of lieutenant. He got married to the British Princess Maud (whom the Norwegian Antarctic territories are named after) in Buckingham Palace in 1896. Since then Carl (the name he mostly used) and Maud travelled between Denmark and Great Britain.\n\nThe lifestyle of the couple would change drastically when Norwegian politicians approached Prince Carl with an offer to become the King of independent Norway as the Union between Norway and Sweden dissolved. The 18th of November 1905, Prince Carl announced through telegram that he would take the name Haakon VII, and that his son and heir (Alexander) would be given the name Olav. The 25th of November he arrived in Norway, and the 27th he took the Oath as Norway's first independent King in 518 years.\n\nNow through some unprecedented further changes towards the traditional, the democratically minded Haakon finds himself as a more absolute and traditional King than ever before. What kind of madman could be behind this development?
POLITICS_VIDKUN_QUISLING_DESC코0=A native of Fyresdal, young Vidkun Quisling was a talented student of humanities, history and natural sciences. In 1905 he enrolled in the Norwegian Military Academy, receiving the highest entrance examination score of the 250 applicants of that particular year. He did so well in his studies he earned an audience with the King, and he later went on to serve as an officer. During the Great War he detested the peace sentiment, but moderated his views after noting the enormous human costs of the war.\n\nSince then he served as an attaché, he served as the military's expert on Russian affairs, he helped Fridtjof Nansen organize humanitarian relief efforts following the Great War, he got married twice, he flirted with the Norwegian communist movement (no doubt inspired by the effective People's Militias of the Soviet Union), he served as the Defense Minister in Peder Kolstad's Agrarian Government (despite being neither an agrarian nor Kolstad's friend, but his experience and knowledge were undeniable), and finally he helped form the political party \"Nasjonal Samling\" out of the former political movement \"Nordisk folkereisning i Norge\". Now he finally represents a party that follows his own political views, a distinct mix of nationalism and socialism.
POLITICS_ADAM_EGEDE_NISSEN_DESC코0=Adam Hjalmar Egede-Nissen was born on a farm in Frol municipality. In his younger years he studied philosophy while working in the postal service, eventually becoming the head of the local distribution center of Vardø in 1897, near the Russian border. In 1900 his political career brought him into the Norwegian Parliament for the first time as a representative of the Liberal Party, Venstre. In 1905 he switched his political allegiance to the Labour Party, where he turned down another period in the Parliament in 1912 in favour of continued work for the Norwegian postal service.\n\nWhile holding experience both with regular jobs and politics, Egede-Nissen was no stranger to more radical approaches to getting things done either, having illegally smuggled and printed revolutionary literature, as well as formed a radical Miner's Union in 1906. His time in Vardø gave him insight into the growing revolutionary sentiment in Russia, which he's since supported to quite a large degree. He was the mayor of Stavanger from 1915 to 1919, during which he was fined for his involvement in the 1919 general strike in support of the Russian revolution. In 1918 he had also went to Russia and met with Lenin, while also attending a meeting dedicated to the formation of the now well known Comintern. When the Labour Party split in 1923, Egede-Nissen followed the more radical politicians and joined the Norwegian Communist Party, NKP.

It hasn't all been smooth sailing, however, as Norway's neutral merchant marine suffered losses during the Great War, and more recently the Great Depression has halted the economy somewhat.\n\nWhile the welfare policies of the Labor led Government has sought to alleviate the issues, this \"Broken Gun\" policy with less defense spending has left Norway at some risk...

NOR_monarchism_on_the_rise_desc코0=Vocal political elements have begun to speak up in favour of our traditional values and the Kingdom of Old, finding support with an increasing number of the population. The Kingdom's path to safe and sound values is merely awaiting the choice of a transition, whether it be peaceful or otherwise.
NOR_prepare_for_monarchist_civil_war코0=Prepare for Civil War
NOR_prepare_for_monarchist_civil_war_desc코0=We have no time to wait for the slow changes in the minds of the people of [Root.GetName]. For their own sake, we must force the matter swiftly, even if some may lose their lives in the process.
NOR_expand_civil_monarchism_support코0=Expand Civil Support
NOR_expand_civil_monarchism_support_desc코0=We must ensure the continuing spread of support among the people of [Root.GetName], even if this causes destabilization of society.
NOR_ensure_command_loyalty_for_monarchist_civil_war코0=Ensure a Loyal Army Command
NOR_ensure_command_loyalty_for_monarchist_civil_war_desc코0=It is likely that many of our commanders harbor traditionalist values, and want to promote these values in society. We should approach them all and ensure their loyalty in the case of internal conflict.
NOR_ensure_command_loyalty_for_monarchist_civil_war_tt코0=Ensures the loyalty of our §YArmy Commanders§! in the case of a §RCivil War§! for §YMonarchism§!\n

NOR_open_up_political_discourse_monarchism코0=Open Up Political Discourse

NOR_ignite_the_monarchist_civil_war코0=Ignite Civil War
NOR_ignite_the_monarchist_civil_war_desc코0=The time has come to take the plunge. All preparations we deemed necessary have been made. There is no turning back now. \"For Fedrelandet!\"
##norwegian land reintegration
NOR_land_reintegration코0=Norwegian Land Reintegration
NOR_land_reintegration_desc코0=The Norwegian Kingdom once stretched widely across Northern Europe, but wars and treaties have left the Kingdom without some of its long held historical lands. Sweden, Denmark and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom, all hold their \"fair\" share of these former islands, titles, landscapes and border regions. Yet, there is still no need to give up hope...\n\nShould we get a hold of any of these territories again, the modern Norwegian state is now in a good position to reintegrate them, with a solid economy and plenty of skilled statesmen. Restoring some of our glorious past should thus well be doable.

NOR_recreate_the_kingdom_of_the_isles_desc코0=Having seized control of the Hebrides and the Highlands, we could attempt to set up a satellite state based on the old Kingdom of the Isles. Under our rule they will be an autonomous duchy promoting Norse-Gaelic ties as a means to align the populace to us.\n\nWhile this would take effort and resources, it might very well be worth it for us to rule the area indirectly, through local lords, land owners and politicians.
NOR_lords_of_the_isles_propaganda_aberdeenshire코0=Spread Lords of the Isles Propaganda to Aberdeenshire
NOR_lords_of_the_isles_propaganda_aberdeenshire_desc코0=By promoting not only Norse-Gaelic ties, but also Highlander ties, we could integrate the Highlanders of Aberdeenshire into our satellite state, [LOI.GetNameDef]. With this they'll have a more significant base of population to recruit from, and our loyalist base on the British Isles will grow significantly.
##partisan operations
NOR_partisan_operations코0=Partisan Operations

##welfare (economic policy)
NOR_finish_the_post-depression_recovery코0=Finish the Post-Depression Recovery
NOR_finish_the_post-depression_recovery_desc코0=With our nation and economy both in relatively good shape, we could divert some significant funds to stamp out the lingering effects of the depression, and proclaim the Nygaardsvold Government's welfare program a resounding success. The Norwegian People would no doubt appreciate such a move for years to come.
##foreign material orders (economic policy)
NOR_procure_british_destroyers코0=Procure British Destroyers
NOR_procure_british_destroyers_desc코0=With the current naval cooperation in our alliance with the British we should be able to procure destroyers from them at very reasonable prices, as it is in everyones best interest with a strong Norwegian Navy.

NOR_glomma-halden_line_desc코0=Hiring contractors to construct a line of bunkers and defenses to the east of Oslo should keep this vital city safe from any would be aggressors. The traditonal invasion route from Sweden into our heartlands ought to have some serious obstacles for any enemy.
NOR_lyngen_line코0=Construct the Lyngen line
NOR_lyngen_line_desc코0=In the case of a neutral Sweden we could stop any land based attacks coming through Northern Norway by contructing a series of fortifications and bunkers at the mountains of the Lyngen area in Troms. The narrow borders would also help funnel any attacker worried about violating Swedish neutrality.
##political actions
NOR_the_kings_choice코0=The King's Choice
NOR_the_kings_choice_desc코0=An emotion laden King has received our enemy's demand for our surrender and appointment of a collaborationist Government.

NOR_rebrand_into_the_modern_kingdom_desc코0=Should we so wish, we could once again take on the modern flag and appearance to the world. This would take a lot of effort from our statesmen though, and rebranding can not be done often.

NOR_rebrand_into_the_traditional_kingdom_desc코0=Should we so wish we could take on the traditional flag and appearance of the Norwegian Kingdom of Old.

NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC코0=Stable politically since its independence, Norway has been hit by the great depression and worries as clouds gather over Europe. Nevertheless the pacifict policies are still in place despite the warnings of the military. In the meantime the economic crisis has made the lower classes more militant, pushed by the small communist party while small groups of nationalists are willing to radically transform society.\n\n
