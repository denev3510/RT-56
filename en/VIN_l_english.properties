# EVENTS #######################################################################################

vietnam.1.t코0=Vietnam's Entry In The Comintern
vietnam.1.d코0=The Vietnamese ambassador to the Soviet Union has just forwarded a request directly from the Vietnamese government.\nThe latter would like Vietnam to join the military alliance around the Soviet Union, hoping to benefit from protection not only for their territory, but also their revolution itself.
vietnam.1.a코0=Tell Uncle Ho He Has Our Protection
vietnam.1.b코0=We Must Refuse

vietnam.2.t코0=The Soviet Union Accepts
vietnam.2.d코0=The Soviet Union has returned a positive response to Vietnam's accession to their military alliance.\nThus, the free movement of troops between our two territories will be put in place, and the latter will help us in the event of a conflict
vietnam.2.a코0=Excellent!

vietnam.3.t코0=The Soviet Union Refuses
vietnam.3.d코0=The Soviet Union has sent a negative response to a military alliance between our two countries. Citing in particular that the current situation is not favourable and that the Soviet Union cannot therefore guarantee Vietnam's defence, they have not, however, denied the fact that an alliance can be concluded in the future, once the world situation has changed.
vietnam.3.a코0=We Can Only Count On Ourselves

vietnam.4.t코0=Communists Attempt Coup!
vietnam.4.d코0=Numerous militias loyal to the Malayan Races Liberation Army, itself affiliated with the Malayan Communist Party, have just deployed in Singapore, and hope to take control of the colonial government in order to not only destroy the British administration, but also to establish a communist regime.\nForces loyal to the government, stationed outside the city, are preparing to take it back, but nothing guarantees their victory.
vietnam.4.a코0=The Coup Succeeds
vietnam.4.b코0=The Coup Fails

vietnam.5.t코0=The Malaysian Coup Has Failed!
vietnam.5.d코0=Communist forces were unable to defend Singapore, and were eventually defeated after a long battle. Many cadres of the Malayan Communist Party were captured or killed, destroying our chances of installing communism in Malaysia from within.
vietnam.5.a코0=We Shall Avenge Our Brothers!

vietnam.6.t코0=Help From The South
vietnam.6.d코0=Kuomintang and VNQDD have always been allies, each wishing to follow the teachings of Sun-Yat-Sen. For years, VNQDD cadres have been protected in China, sheltered from the French police.\nAs China finds itself in a state of war again, the Vietnamese government has sent us a request so that it can help us.
vietnam.6.a코0=Together We Are Stronger
vietnam.6.b코0=We Don't Need Their Help
ASIAN_LEAGUE_NAME코0=Asian League

vietnam.7.t코0=China Refuses Our Help
vietnam.7.d코0=The Chinese government has declined our request to help them. It is clear that we cannot rely on their protection, and they cannot rely on ours.
vietnam.7.a코0=We Shall Respect Their Decision


vietnam.8.t코0=Victory!
vietnam.8.d코0=While the last French troops were forced to leave the Indochinese Peninsula, we can easily declare victory. The French opression is now behind us!
vietnam.8.a코0=Hurray!

vietnam.9.t코0=Ho Chi Minh's Leadership
vietnam.9.d코0=Nguyen Ai Quoc, better known by his nickname of Ho-Chi-Minh, leader of the Viet-Minh and a true figure of the Vietnamese resistance to colonialism, trained in Marxist and Leninist ideas while in the Soviet Union before returning to guide the rebellion against the colonial administration. He became more than a leader, he became the new father of the Vietnamese nation. May he guide Vietnam to an age of prosperity.
vietnam.9.a코0=Hurray!

vietnam.10.t코0=La Lutte's Leadership
vietnam.10.d코0=Ta Thu Thau, leader of "La Lutte", who had been working for months to organize a real socialist opposition to French colonization, found himself and his Trotskyist colleagues leading the rebellion that liberated Vietnam. Seen as a figure of hope and freedom, the latter has attracted the support of both farmers and urban workers, making him the obvious choice to lead our nation.
vietnam.10.a코0=Hurray!

vietnam.11.t코0=VNQDD Leadership
vietnam.11.d코0=Nguyen Tuong Tam, leader of the VNQDD, one of the oldest and most active parties advocating Vietnam's independence, has managed to restore the power that his party had lost in the past, by rebuilding it after it had been almost completely destroyed by the French administration. The main leader of the rebellion, he has succeeded in taking over the leadership of the rebellion, and with the support of the people, who now see him as a national hero, he can put in place the policies that his party has been advocating for so long.
vietnam.11.a코0=Hurray!

vietnam.12.t코0=Cuong De's Leadership
vietnam.12.d코0=While there seemed to be every reason to believe that the Vietnamese rebellion would be accompanied by a form of internal revolution, in particular the birth of a republic, Cuong De, a member of the imperial dynasty and a great supporter of Vietnamese independence for decades, gained the necessary support to enable him to lead the rebellion. Helped mainly by the powerful elites who turned around following the victory of the independentists, the latter has a vision of Vietnam that is very specific to him while being inspired by regimes like Japan, where the latter has managed to gain enough support to help him in the War of Independence.
vietnam.12.a코0=Hurray!

vietnam.13.t코0=A Divided Leadership
vietnam.13.d코0=The forces fighting for Vietnam's independence were many, each with radically different ideas than the others, making long-term cooperation simply impossible. Now that the war is over, only one can win.
vietnam.13.a코0=Ho-Chi-Minh Shall Lead Us!
vietnam.13.b코0=La Lutte And The Trotskyists
vietnam.13.c코0=The VNQDD!
vietnam.13.e코0=Cuong De!

vietnam.14.t코0=The Independence War
vietnam.14.d코0=It is now time for us to repel the French invader. Vietnam will be independent again!

#######################################################################################


VIN_ho_chi_minh_victorious코0=Ho Chi Minh Victorious!
VIN_ho_chi_minh_victorious_desc코0=Despite all the machinations of counterrevolutionary forces and Trotskyist traitors, Ho Chi Minh was able to impose his authority throughout Vietnam. Vietnam's total liberation will only be achieved if it is freed from capitalist chains, and we will use all the necessary means to build a socialist Vietnam.
VIN_land_rent_reduction_campaign코0=Land Rent Reduction Campaign
VIN_three_together_system코0=The Three Together System
VIN_three_together_system_desc코0=The "Three Together System" is the act of sending party officials to live in landless peasant villages, working together, eating together and living together. In this way, we will obtain enough information about the villages to start our agrarian reforms, in addition to sensitizing them to the class struggle.
VIN_cement_rule_in_the_villages코0=Cement Rule In The Villages
VIN_cement_rule_in_the_villages_desc코0=In Vietnam, there is a saying called “Phép Vua Thua Lệ Làng”, literally meaning that the emperor is secondary to village customs and implicitly indicating that national rule at the village was given a way to autonomous rule by village itself. If we wish to maintain the government authority, it is necessary to bring all the villages under the supreme authority of the government.
VIN_land_reforms_program코0=Land Reforms Program
VIN_land_reforms_program_desc코0=It is now time to enact legislation that will allow us to implement our land reform programme. The latter will take place province by province, and a Central Land Reform Committee will be established to oversee the latter.
VIN_begin_the_five_years_plan코0=Begin The Five Years Plan
VIN_begin_the_five_years_plan_desc코0=The economy can only develop if it is centralized under the party. To build socialism in Vietnam, we need to launch a major nationwide industrialization plan.
VIN_woo_the_stalinists코0=Woo The Stalinists
VIN_woo_the_stalinists_desc코0=The Soviet Union is our natural ally. In addition to having helped us in our independence struggle and having helped Ho Chi Minh to be trained in Marxist Leninist ideas, being under their protection would allow us to avoid seeing our revolution attacked by counter-revolutionary forces.
VIN_the_permanent_siege코0=The Permanent Siege
VIN_the_permanent_siege_desc코0=We are isolated from the rest of our communist brothers. Mao is isolated in the mountains while an ocean separates us from the Soviet Union. We will turn this situation into a propaganda tool, by insufflating in our people their duty to defend both the revolution and the country.
VIN_asian_proletarian_solidarity코0=Asian Proletarian Solidarity
ASIAN_PROLETARIAN_SOLIDARITY_FACTION코0=Asian Proletarian Solidarity
VIN_asian_proletarian_solidarity_desc코0=We are the first to have defeated the colonialists and liberated our country from imperialism. But throughout Asia, peoples continue to suffer under the yoke of the colonial capitalist powers. We will provide all our support to the various Asian communist movements in order to defeat colonialism once and for all!
VIN_intervene_in_chineses_affairs코0=Intervene In Chineses Affairs
VIN_intervene_in_chineses_affairs_desc코0=Our Chinese communist comrades were also a great help but also a source of inspiration for Ho Chi Minh. However, Kuomintang reactionaries continue to chase them away and repress them. It is time to intervene and save our brothers.
VIN_invite_soviet_industrial_experts코0=Invite Soviets Industrial Experts
VIN_invite_soviet_industrial_experts_desc코0=The Soviets were able to transform Russia from a peasant nation into an industrial monster through radical reforms carried out by competent people. These same people could help us industrialize ourselves, something we need given the low importance given by the French to the development of heavy industry.
VIN_create_the_hanoi_group코0=Create The Hanoi Group
VIN_create_the_hanoi_group_desc코0=To make up for our scientific backwardness, Truong Chinh proposed a great idea: To create a large scientific centre in Hanoi welcoming any scientist adhering to socialist ideals. We could then pass on these technological advances to our other communist allies.
VIN_formalise_the_alliance코0=Formalise The Alliance
VIN_formalise_the_alliance_desc코0=The victory of the communists in China is assured. It is now time to sign an alliance treaty with them and launch the final battle to get rid of the Chinese reactionary forces once and for all.
VIN_anti_japanese_aim코0=Anti-Japanese Aim
VIN_anti_japanese_aim_desc코0=Japan is a nation hungry for blood, power and conquest. They have subjugated Korea, Manchuria, and soon it will be all of Asia. We cannot allow such a tyrannical nation to continue without being stopped. We will arrange with our Soviet colleagues an invasion of Japan to bring it into the communist sphere.
VIN_looking_beyond코0=Looking Beyond
VIN_political_reorganisation_of_the_army코0=Political Reorganisation Of The Army
VIN_political_reorganisation_of_the_army_desc코0=The army is necessary to protect and spread the revolution. But it could also still be filled with traitors, who could be loyal to Trotskyists in particular. Taking the Soviet purges as an example, we too should get rid of officers deemed "potentially dangerous".
VIN_finish_what_we_started코0=Finish What We Started
VIN_finish_what_we_started_desc코0=Despite our personal victory against the capitalist forces, Laos and Cambodia continue to suffer under oppressive and capitalist regimes. It is our duty to liberate them in the same way that we liberated ourselves.
VIN_finish_what_we_started_tt코0=If §YLaos§! Or §YCambodia§! Is Not §YCommunist§!, We Will Gain A Wargoal Against Them
VIN_prepare_for_the_worst코0=Prepare For The Worst
VIN_prepare_for_the_worst_desc코0=It is clear that we are tackling real colossuses, much stronger and more numerous than we are. Despite all our goodwill, fortifications will probably be needed to help our soldiers.
VIN_la_lutte_victorious코0=La Lutte
VIN_la_lutte_victorious_desc코0=The Struggle defeated the counterrevolutionaries as well as the Stalinist traitors, and is ready to implement a policy of revolutionary socialism based on Leon Trotsky's ideals.
VIN_minimal_socialist_bureaucracy코0=Minimal Socialist Bureaucracy
VIN_minimal_socialist_bureaucracy_desc코0=The excessive bureaucracy, characteristic of the Stalinist regimes, transforms them into a simple disguised hierarchy. To avoid this kind of drift, which in the long run would lead us once again to the exploitation of workers by the upper classes, the bureaucracy must remain minimal, particularly through greater regional autonomy.
VIN_immediate_land_reform코0=Immediate Land Reform
VIN_immediate_land_reform_desc코0=If we want to free the peasants, collectivization must be done immediately and without any compromise with the landlords. Farmers will be encouraged to collectivize themselves with the support of the party.
VIN_the_permanent_revolution_theory코0=The Permanent Revolution Theory
VIN_the_permanent_revolution_theory_desc코0=The Permanent Revolution, a key point of Trotskyism, is the fact of having to see revolution as something that will only end once the whole of capitalism has been eradicated. Support for socialist movements, not only in Asia, but all over the world, must be our priority.
VIN_encourage_inter_party_democracy코0=Encourage Inter-Party Democracy
VIN_encourage_inter_party_democracy_desc코0=Despite the existence of a single revolutionary party, it must be open to different ways of approaching and developing Vietnamese socialism. Monthly meetings to review policies and the establishment of a "People's Assembly" will allow us to better understand the needs of the population and thus adapt to them.
VIN_a_gun_in_every_hand코0=A Gun In Every Hand...
VIN_a_gun_in_every_hand_desc코0=Much of the revolution must be led by the people themselves. To help them in their fight against capitalist exploitation, everyone will have the right to own a firearm and will train their own militias to defend revolutionary ideals.
VIN_our_own_internationale코0=Our Own Internationale
VIN_our_own_internationale_desc코0=The Stalinist traitors have taken control of the Third International. The formation of an alliance against their tyranny is necessary to secure and propagate the real revolution.
ASIAN_INTERNATIONALE_FACTION코0=Asian Internationale
VIN_align_with_trotsky_regime코0=Align With Trotsky's Regime
VIN_align_with_trotsky_regime_desc코0=Leon Trotsky, Lenin's legitimate successor, succeeded in obtaining power. It is by aligning ourselves with him that the permanent revolution can be spread!
VIN_align_with_trotsky_regime_tt코0=We Will Send A Request To §YTrotsky§! To Join His Faction
VIN_mimic_the_red_army코0=Mimic The Red Army
VIN_mimic_the_red_army_desc코0=The Red Army, then led by Trotsky, did a tremendous job of defeating the White Forces. It is by following their example, in particular by inviting some of their officers to Vietnam, that we too can create such a victorious army.
VIN_a_factory_in_every_city코0=...And A Factory In Every City
VIN_a_factory_in_every_city_desc코0=Revolution can only be achieved by the workers. Farmers are far too dependent on landowners, and thus will have much more difficulty rejecting capitalism. Developing our industry through public works will help to increase the working population.
VIN_the_urban_revolution코0=The Urban Revolution
VIN_personnal_armament_program코0=Personnal Armament Program
VIN_personnal_armament_program_desc코0=Much of the revolution must be led by the people themselves. To help them in their fight against capitalist exploitation, everyone will have the right to own a firearm and will train their own militias to defend revolutionary ideals.
VIN_invite_poum_officers코0=Invite POUM Officers
VIN_invite_poum_officers_desc코0=The POUM, the Spanish Trotskyist party, was betrayed by those who were supposed to be its allies, namely the Spanish Republican government, under the orders of the Stalinist USSR. Fortunately, some of his executives, experienced in addition, managed to escape repression. They would be formidable allies in our fight against Stalinism.
VIN_poum_officers코0=POUM Officers
VIN_poum_officers_desc코0=The POUM, the Spanish Trotskyist party, was betrayed by those who were supposed to be its allies, namely the Spanish Republican government, under the orders of the Stalinist USSR. Fortunately, some of its officers, experienced in addition, managed to escape repression. They would be formidable allies in our fight against Stalinism.
VIN_strike_indochina코0=Strike Indochina
VIN_strike_indochina_desc코0=The governments that rule Laos and Cambodia are both opressive and capitalist. It is our duty to liberate our brotherly peoples, for the sake of socialism and permanent revolution.
VIN_arm_malaysians_communists코0=Arm Malaysians Communists
VIN_arm_malaysians_communists_desc코0=Malaysia is very close to us and could provide us with a great starting point for spreading the revolution throughout Southeast Asia. We have contacted many communist movements in the region, most of which have taken refuge in Vietnam for fear of repression by the colonial government.
VIN_fullfil_our_duty코0=Fullfil Our Duty
VIN_fullfil_our_duty_desc코0=The fight ended only after the last capitalist had been defeated. Our soldiers will cross mountains and forests to free the world from its chains and fulfill our revolutionary duty.
VIN_expand_the_workers_class코0=Expand The Workers Class
VIN_expand_the_workers_class_desc코0=Revolution can only be achieved by the workers. Farmers are far too dependent on landowners, and thus will have much more difficulty rejecting capitalism. Developing our industry through public works will help to increase the working population.
VIN_the_internal_fight_continues코0=The Internal Fight Continues
VIN_the_internal_fight_continues_desc코0=It would be dangerous to think that by simply taking power from the communists, the capitalists will have disappeared from our territory. Capitalism is a method of thought rooted for centuries in the minds of oppressed peoples, and it is only by showing the way to the people that we will succeed in building a more just world.
VIN_the_vnqdd_in_power코0=The VNQDD In Power
VIN_the_vnqdd_in_power_desc코0=The VNQDD has established itself as the main force of the rebellion and is now in power. Its objectives remain the same since its creation, namely the foundation of a democratic Vietnamese republic.
VIN_gradual_agrarian_reform코0=Gradual Agrarian Reform
VIN_gradual_agrarian_reform_desc코0=A good way to get farmers to support the republic is to redistribute the land they cultivate. We may encounter opposition from the landowners, but their influence has diminished significantly since the country's independence.
VIN_help_the_kuomintang코0=Help The Kuomintang
VIN_help_the_kuomintang_desc코0=Our Kuomintang allies are caught between internal enemies such as the communists, and external threats such as the Japanese Empire. It is our duty to help them after all the support we have received from them during our long years of struggle against the colonial government.
VIN_dan_toc코0=Dan Toc
VIN_dan_toc_desc코0=Our first and most important struggle was obviously to restore the Vietnamese nation, independent of any foreign influence. All Vietnamese must understand that the very existence of our nation depends on their courage and determination to defend their homeland.
VIN_dan_toc2코0=Dan Toc
VIN_dan_toc2코0=Our first and most important struggle was obviously to restore the Vietnamese nation, independent of any foreign influence. All Vietnamese must understand that the very existence of our nation depends on their courage and determination to defend their homeland.
VIN_dan_chu코0=Dan Chu
VIN_dan_chu_desc코0=Exploited for decades under a tyrannical colonial government acting on behalf of a country that claims to be democratic but has never allowed the voices of indigenous people to be heard, we must show our commitment to democratic principles by ensuring that they can operate smoothly and be as representative as possible.
VIN_dan_chu2코0=Dan Chu
VIN_dan_chu2_desc코0=Exploited for decades under a tyrannical colonial government acting on behalf of a country that claims to be democratic but has never allowed the voices of indigenous people to be heard, we must show our commitment to democratic principles by ensuring that they can operate smoothly and be as representative as possible.
VIN_hanh_phuc코0=Hanh Phuc
VIN_hanh_phuc_desc코0=The main role of the state, and of elected representatives, is to improve the living conditions of the population and protect it from exploitation and poverty. A new tax system will be introduced to enable a social security system to be set up.
VIN_hanh_phuc2코0=Hanh Phuc
VIN_hanh_phuc2_desc코0=The main role of the state, and of elected representatives, is to improve the living conditions of the population and protect it from exploitation and poverty. A new tax system will be introduced to enable a social security system to be set up.
VIN_vietnams_tridemism코0=Vietnam's Tridemism
VIN_vietnams_tridemism_desc코0=The VNQDD was strongly inspired by Kuomintang and in particular its founder, Sun Yat-Sen. Among his many ideas, his three principles of the people are among the most important. What can be done in China can also be done here, so we will apply its ideals in our new republic.
VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments코0=Establish The Regionals Parliaments
VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments_desc코0=A good way to help in local representation would be to create a parliament for each of Vietnam's three regions: Cochin China, Annam and Tonkin. This parliament would be just below the federal parliament in terms of power, and could take decisions, particularly on the budget.
VIN_build_the_quang_bich_line코0=Build The Quand Bich Line
VIN_build_the_quang_bich_line_desc코0=The confrontation against the Japanese empire will take place largely on land, but they may also attempt naval invasions, accentuated by our much smaller naval army. A coastal fortification program will be implemented to prevent amphibious invasion.
VIN_incochinese_neutrality코0=Indochinese Neutrality
VIN_incochinese_neutrality_desc코0=We have spilled enough Vietnamese blood to gain our independence. It would be foolish to intervene in other conflicts. The reconstruction of Vietnam must be our priority. 
VIN_mutual_defensive_treaty코0=Mutual Defensive Treaty
VIN_mutual_defensive_treaty_desc코0=A defensive treaty with our Laotian and Cambodian brothers would allow us to have our western front fully secured and potential allies in case someone violates our neutrality.
VIN_anti_japanese_guerrila_tactics코0=Anti-Japanese Guerrila Tactics
VIN_anti_japanese_guerrila_tactics_desc코0=The Japanese army may be better equipped, but we know the terrain and how to exploit it to our advantage better than anyone else. Tactics of harassing moving troops as well as discreet resupply attacks should do enough damage to allow us to better defend ourselves and then repel them.
VIN_a_light_of_hope_over_asia코0=A Light Of Hope Over Asia
VIN_influence_our_brothers코0=Influence Our Brothers
VIN_influence_our_brothers_desc코0=Our democratic success will show the Cambodian and Laotian people the way to a nation that acts for the people.
VIN_establish_the_ve_binh_cong_hoa코0=Establish The Ve Binh Cong Hoa
VIN_establish_the_ve_binh_cong_hoa_desc코0=The "Ve Binh Cong Hoa", or "Republican Guard", will be paramilitary units under the leadership of the government and independent of the army. We hope to increase our number of reservists in this way
VIN_the_new_emperor코0=The New Emperor

VIN_cooperation_with_japan코0=Cooperation With Japan
VIN_cooperation_with_japan_desc코0=Japan is a model for Cuong De. This nation, which has been able to defeat the European imperialists and create its own sphere of influence, is something that any proud Asian nation should seek to replicate. At their side, we too shall become a great empire.
VIN_cooperation_with_landlords코0=Cooperation With Landlords
VIN_cooperation_with_landlords_desc코0=Landlords are vital to the functioning of a country. Rather than trying to take what they have, we should support them and get theirs in return.
VIN_centralise_the_regions코0=Centralise The Regions
VIN_centralise_the_regions_desc코0=Decentralization is bad for the functioning of the country as well as for its national unity, which France understood well. The three-region system will be abolished and replaced by subdivisions much more subject to central government.
VIN_crush_the_republicans코0=Crush The Republicans
VIN_crush_the_republicans_desc코0=Vietnamese Republicans have proved to be the regime's new enemy. Hidden in the forest, the latter oppose the monarchist government. It is imperative that we neutralize them in order to prevent them from causing too much damage.
VIN_the_hoi_quy_toc코0=The Hoi Quy Toc
VIN_the_hoi_quy_toc_desc코0=The "Hoi Quy Toc" will be an assembly composed of nobles and mandarins loyal to Cuong De in order to help it in its decision-making at the level of domestic or foreign policy. Without holding a real legislative power, this assembly would ensure greater loyalty from the nobility while surrounding us with competent people. 
VIN_royal_corporatism코0=Royal Corporatism
VIN_royal_corporatism_desc코0=All over Vietnam, many businesses, large and small, are developing. Guiding them through nationalism would allow a better collaboration of the classes for the good of the nation.
VIN_deploy_the_dan_quan_hoang_gia코0=Deploy The Dan Quan Hoang Gia
VIN_deploy_the_dan_quan_hoang_gia_desc코0=The creation of a militia under Cuong De's direct command would make it easier to suppress disruptive elements and inspire the population.
VIN_the_new_mandarin_system코0=The New Mandarin System
VIN_reform_the_royal_administration코0=Reform The Royal Administration
VIN_reform_the_royal_administration_desc코0=The royal administration must be modernized on the basis of Meiji Japan. In particular, the emperor's authority must be strengthened.
VIN_the_lone_dragon코0=The Lone Dragon
VIN_the_lone_dragon_desc코0=Despite all the assistance Japan has offered us to gain independence, cooperation between our two nations is not possible, and Vietnam must forge its own path.
VIN_the_greater_vietnam_concept코0=The Greater Vietnam Concept
VIN_the_greater_vietnam_concept_desc코0=To ensure the survival of the Vietnamese people, they must push back their borders so that they encompass the entire Indochinese peninsula. In addition, Vietnamese mills already live in the regions of Laos and Cambodia.
VIN_cross_the_cangshan_desc코0=Attacking China through the mountains of Yunnan will surprise them, especially if our soldiers are much better equipped for this terrain.
VIN_cross_the_cangshan코0=Cross The Cangshan
VIN_cross_the_cangshan_tt코0=Enables §HMountain Warfare§!\nAll Infantry : \n    §HMountain§!\n      Movement: §G+10%§!\n    §HHills§!\n      Movement: §G+10%§!\n\n§HMarines\n    Mountain§!\n      Attack: §G+5%§!\n    §HHills§!\n      Attack: §G+5%§!\n      \n§HMountaineers\n    Mountain§!\n      Attack: §G+5%§!\n    §HHills§!\n      Attack: §G+5%§!\n      \n§HParatroopers\n    Mountain§!\n      Attack: §G+5%§!\n    §HHills§!\n      Attack: §G+5%§!\n
VIN_trade_with_the_reorganised_government코0=Trade With Reorganized China
VIN_trade_with_the_reorganised_government_desc코0=The new Chinese government, set up with the support of Japan, represents a perfect opportunity for cooperation between our two nations, which have long been close. A trade agreement with them will be signed.
VIN_rule_the_thais코0=Rule The Thais
VIN_rule_the_thais_desc코0=Siam represents a threat to the Vietnamese domination of Indochina, because of their linguistic and cultural proximity to the Laos and Khmer peoples, the latter could very well try to regain them when we least expect it. 
VIN_total_economic_mobilization코0=Total Economic Mobilization
VIN_total_economic_mobilization_desc코0=For the sake of Vietnam, with the conflicts coming closer, it is necessary that each inhabitant face his best to help the war economy. Rationing, propaganda for the military industry, everything must be put in place to allow Vietnam to survive.
VIN_establish_the_national_army_of_vietnam코0=Establish The National Army Of Vietnam
VIN_establish_the_national_army_of_vietnam_desc코0=Due to the fact that our independence troops were mainly militias, hierarchical organization was barely present. With our independence regained, it is time for us to build a real army to defend our country.
VIN_create_the_hanoi_military_college코0=Create The Hanoi Military College

VIN_the_flying_dragon_theory_desc코0=The "Flying Dragon" theory is based on a rather simple observation. The free flow of foreign investment, such as a dragon flying freely, provided of course that it is partially monitored by the government to avoid a new colonial situation, would be the best strategy for Vietnam. After all, we are in a resource-rich region, which would obviously attract those looking for new regions to invest in.
VIN_the_roaring_dragon_theory코0=The "Roaring Dragon" Theory
VIN_the_roaring_dragon_theory_desc코0=The "Roaring Dragon" theory is an economic theory supporting the notion that for Vietnam to achieve a level of economic development close to that of European industrialized nations, the latter must focus on perfect coordination of the agricultural and industrial sectors.
