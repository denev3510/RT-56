greece.6.b코0=We can't afford a war with Italy! Stand down.

greece.10.t코0=Turkey refused
greece.10.d코0=The Turkish Prime Minister has characterized our claims foolish and that we are not worth of his time. Obviously this is an insult to our nation and an imminent war between our countries is dangerously close.

greece.10.a코0=This was just a temporary truce.
greece.8.t코0=Turkish offerings
greece.8.d코0=It seems that our foes want to come into a compromise, they offer Constantinople and an amount of payment but nothing more. After that we will be forced to accept a non-aggression pact with them ensuring peace in the region.
greece.8.a코0=Oh, well.
greece.8.b코0=We would never make such a foolish move!
greece.11.t코0=Britain Refused
greece.11.d코0=The British Prime Minister has denied to give us membership in their alliance. We didn't really expect things to end up like this...
greece.11.a코0=What!?
greece.12.t코0=Britain Refused

greece.12.a코0=Now what?
greece.13.t코0=The Soviets refused
greece.13.d코0=Despite our generous offer, the soviets disagreed and stated that they don't want to provoke any 'disputes with the Italian State'.

greece.14.a코0=How will this end?
greece.9.t코0=Treaty Of Athens

greece.16.t코0=Operation Restoration
greece.16.d코0=Our government has decided, with support from the military high command, to push further deeper into Anatolia and reclaim lost lands such as Nicomedia and the city of our hearts Constantinople.

greece.16.a코0=It would be better if we asked for help first.
greece.16.b코0=Let's not get them involved.
greece.17.t코0=Greece asks for intervention
greece.17.d코0=Earlier today as Hellenic forces poised to attack the Turkish border, the Greek ambassador in our Capital has suggested that we intervene in the upcoming war between them and Turkey. This will greatly upset our neighbors and will definately damage our reputation.

greece.17.b코0=This is not what the Traty of Athens suggested!
greece.18.t코0=Intervention rejected!
greece.18.d코0=Despite our ambassador's efforts we couldn't come to an agreement. They definitely won't help us and they even rejected any sort of protecting our country from any possible future enemies since we did not respect Athen's Treaty.
greece.18.a코0=Oh shit!
greece.19.t코0=Treaty of Rome
greece.19.d코0=The Italians have agreed to support us over the new issue that erupted between us and Turkey. Obviously in exchange for some lands for the Italians, that is the only way we could get them support us and even that troubled them.

greece.20.d코0=The Greek ambassador in Rome has called for a full support of the Greek campaign in Anatolia. It sounds, troubling to say the least, but this could be our only chance to work on the Anatolian campaign once again!

greece.23.t코0=Prousa Reclaimed!
greece.23.d코0=After all these years we have finally reclaimed Prousa and established a new Hellenic administration. Finally our dream of restoring the empire is close!

greece.28.t코0=Greece wants to join the axis
greece.28.d코0= Today the Greek foreign minister has met with our representatives and proposed an offer to join the Axis. By accepting them in we may upset our relations with Italy but we could surely use their airbases for possible campaigns in northern Africa and threaten the British Royal Navy.

greece.31.t코0=Greece demands the Dodecanese
greece.31.d코0= Today the Greek foreign minister has met with our representatives demanding that Rhodes alongside the other Dodecanese islands which are 'rightfully Greek' as he mentioned must be returned immediately. Of course giving a base so important to them would be a foolish move.

greece.25.d코0= Today the Greek foreign minister has discussed with our representatives about a serious issue that greatly affects our relationships with Greece.

greece.25.a코0=Yes, we don't want any military engages with Greece.
greece.25.b코0=What? No, Cyprus must be defended!
greece.26.t코0=Greece seeks Allied membership
greece.26.d코0=Today the Greek ambassador in London met with our Prime Minister telling him about how much the Greek people admire the British Nation and proposed an alliance between our two nations. This could come in handy since Crete could be used as an important naval base for our Mediterranean Fleet and reduce Italian influence in the Balkans.
greece.26.a코0=Yes, let them join.
greece.26.b코0=Maybe not.
greece.27.t코0=Greece asks for Cyprus
greece.27.d코0=It seems that the Greeks have not forgotten about the promise we made them to give Cyprus if they joined the Great War and insist that we should give them Cyprus. This is a base of great military importance but we could still use it as a base since they are in our faction but is it really worth giving it?
greece.27.a코0=Yes give it to them, we keep our promises.
greece.27.b코0=I don't remember any promise...

greece.29.d코0= The Greek foreign minister has met with our President demanding of a treaty be signed in which multiple regions such as Izmir, Izmit, Instabul and others be ceded to its' 'rightful owner', obviously they can't be taken serious. Making such foolish claims is obviously not worth of our time but they may be having the backing of the Axis. Perhaps we could come into a compromise and gain funds, or not.
greece.29.a코0=Never!
greece.29.b코0=Offer them 'Constantinople' but nothing more!
greece.30.t코0=Greeks offer to join our faction
greece.30.d코0=Today the Greek representative in Moscow has met with our foreign minister and offered to join our faction in order to help us.

greece.32.a코0=Doksa ston Metaxa!
greece.33.t코0=Fascist leadership?
greece.33.d코0=The Fascist Party is currently lead by Georgios Merkouris however we can change this and replace him with another candidate, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos has proved himself to be useful and cunning,although this does not shove merkouris out of the picture, he has proved himself to be as cunning as logothetopoulos.
greece.33.a코0=Merkouris shall lead the fascist party!
greece.33.b코0=Rallis Leads The Fascist Party.
