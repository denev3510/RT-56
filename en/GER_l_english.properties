erwache.1.t코0=Appointing Economic Positions
erwache.1.d코0=We have two appointment options for the offices of Reichsbank President and Economic Minister. One of the possible appointees, Hjalmar Schacht, is very good at working with Germany's companies and developing civilain infrastructure, but his lack of loyalty to the NSDAP and distain for military spending make him a worrying choice. Our second possible appointee, Walther Funk, is very loyal to the NSDAP and is a major proponent of military spending. If we are to make any good progress with German recovery, we must choose one of these two men to lead our economy.

erwache.1.b코0=Walther Funk
erwache.2.t코0=The Problem of the Steelworks
erwache.2.d코0=As the German military grows, we must ensure that we have a secure and stable source of steel. Our current primary steel producer, Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG, has been a valuable ally in the NSDAP's rise to power and is a major employer of German workers. But, the Stahlwerke hasn't been yielding as much steel as it could be; forming and supporting Reichswerke Hermann Göring instead may yield a significantly larger amount of steel and support the German war effort more effectively.
erwache.2.a코0=Reichswerke Hermann Göring
erwache.2.b코0=Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG
erwache.4.t코0=The Fall of the Nazis
erwache.4.d코0=After the rapid rise of monarchists and other pro-Kaiser parties, the NSDAP has found no alternatives but to surrender control of the German government. This historic decision is being officially declared in the German Reichstag, but it is still unknown who will reign as the Kaiser of the new Fourth Reich. We can either call upon Wilhelm the Second, the ruler of the Second Reich during the Great War, or Prince Wilhelm the Third, son of Wilhelm the Second and a man very much capable of holding this historic position.
erwache.4.a코0=Wilhelm II will lead us
erwache.4.b코0=Prince Wilhelm III will lead us
erwache.5.t코0=The German Civil War
erwache.5.d코0=Monarchists led a sucessful coup against the NSDAP, storming the Reichstag and taking over the government. In the ashes of the burned-down Reichstag, former Chancellor Adolf Hitler lays dead, leaving Heinrich Himmler as the new head of government stationed in Munich. Himmler and the remaining Nazi loyalists have started a civil war against our new imperial government, and we must fight to reunify Germany. Who will lead us on our path to the unified Fourth Riech: former Kaiser Wilhelm II or his son, Prince Wilhelm III?
erwache.5.a코0=Wilhelm II will lead us
erwache.5.b코0=Prince Wilhelm III will lead us
erwache.6.t코0=Germany Demands Defensive Occupation
erwache.6.d코0=Germany has long had interests in our country, but even this is a surprising eventuality. Germany is demanding that we allow their forces to occupy our country, essentially turning us into a puppet.
erwache.6.a코0=We need defense from our enemies
erwache.6.b코0=We will not cede our freedom!
erwache.7.t코0=Germany Offers Peace!
erwache.7.d코0=The Soviet Union has been proposed treaty to end the German-Soviet war in the East. The treaty included terms to cede several western Soviet-occupied territories to the Germans in exchange for peace. These terms are similar to the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ended the German-Soviet conflict during the First World War.
erwache.7.a코0=Reject the Terms!

# Events to kill Hitler

r56_kill_hitler.1.t코0=Hitler Killed by an Explosion
r56_kill_hitler.1.desc코0=\nGermany seems to be shaken by a coup attempt as group of Wehrmacht officers succeeded in killing Hitler. During an exhibition of the latest weapons produced in the Reich, an officer guiding the Fürher carried a bomb and used it to kill the German Chancellor and two of his bodyguards.
r56_kill_hitler.1.a코0=A coup?
r56_kill_hitler.2.t코0=The German Chancellor Gunned Down!
r56_kill_hitler.2.desc코0=\nWhile he was doing a speech during one of his typical rallies, Adolf Hitler, the Chancellor of Germany has been attacked by a group of hitmen armed with submachine guns. In a matter of seconds, they devastated the tribune with a hail of bullets before fleeing the hall, killing and wounding multiple SS guards in the process.
r56_kill_hitler.2.a코0=A coup?
r56_kill_hitler.3.t코0=Hitler killed in Martial Artist's Attack!
r56_kill_hitler.3.desc코0=The assistance of last night's rally in Berlin was stunned when an unknown man arrived on stage, inviting the Führer to fight him. Hitler stopped bodyguards before revealing that he was the Kung Führer and that he knew that a Kung Fu master would one day try to challenge him. The mysterious man presented himself as Brandson Lee before attacking the German Chancellor with the wrath of a tiger. The duel lasted multiple minutes. The hits where apparently so quick that it was difficult to follow the action, but suddenly the intruder planted his hand into the Führer's chest. The Führer let out a single gasp before collapsing to the ground. The SS then fired at the assassin, but he managed to dodge multiple bullets and stop others with his bare hands before escaping through a side door, chopping multiple sentries in the process.
r56_kill_hitler.3.a코0=A coup?
r56_kill_hitler.4.t코0=Hitler's Plane Crashed!
r56_kill_hitler.4.desc코0=\nAn official report has confirmed that the wreck of the plane which crashed soon after takeoff from Tempelhoff airport is indeed the private plane of the Führer who was on board at the time.

r56_kill_hitler.4.a코0=A coup?
r56_kill_hitler.5.t코0=The Chancellery wrecked by an explosion!
r56_kill_hitler.5.desc코0=Last evening a loud noise and a tremendous blast devastated [GER.getleader]'s desk at the Reich chancellery in Berlin. The bodyguards were powerless and could only see the remaining bits of his uniform and the iron cross shining among the fuming ashes.
r56_kill_hitler.5.a코0=A coup?
r56_kill_hitler.6.t코0=Hitler killed by hitman at the Obersatlzberg!
r56_kill_hitler.6.desc코0=\nA surprising communiqué has confirmed the rumors that the German Chancellor [GER.getleader] has been killed while he was resting in his alpine villa. Hit in the head by a single bullet shot from far away, it is clear that the hitman was a very skilled marksman, which would imply some form of military training.
