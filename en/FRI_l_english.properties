FRI_colonial_army_desc코0=Despite the conscription of some indigenous people, particularly within the Indochinese Skirmishers, Indochina remains largely dependent on France for its defence. Local conscription is quite low due to the colonial character of the administration as well as the low potential for mobilization as a large part of the population is made of farmers.
FRI_illiteracy코0=Illiteracy
FRI_illiteracy_desc코0=Since the beginning of the French presence in Indochina, great efforts have been made to improve access to education. In 1907 the University of Hanoi was founded and from 1917 onwards, French was taught in all Franco-Indigenous schools. Despite all this, more than 80% of the population remains illiterate, especially in Laos and Cambodia where efforts in favour of education were much lower and no secondary schools exist.

FRI_unequal_economic_developement_desc코0=Despite the nickname "Pearl of the Empire", it is only the Vietnamese part of Indochina that is generally profitable. Laos and Cambodia are far behind in terms of infrastructure or businesses, particularly related to the much more hostile nature of their environment or their small population. This could prove dangerous due to the rise of Vietnamese nationalist movements, which are much less present in our other two regions.

In such a strong struggle, all the independence forces have agreed to cooperate in order to focus their efforts on fighting and mobilizing the population.\nHowever, what soldiers see much less is that internal conflicts between the different factions continue to exist. If it cannot be resolved on the battlefield, it shall be resolved behind it...\n\nFour factions are fighting for the future control of independent Vietnam.

# EVENTS
frenchindochina.1.t코0=Jules Brévié Named Gouverneur Général
frenchindochina.1.d코0=Jules Brévié, former Governor of French West Africa, was appointed by the [FRA.GetRulingParty] government as Governor General of Indochina, replacing René Robin.\nA humanist and a liberal, Brévié is very much focused on an approach to colonization that he calls "scientific", starting from a profound study of indigenous cultures and the improvement of their living conditions, as he had implemented many social reforms during the Great Depression in French Africa, subsidising Senegalese workers and setting up programmes to increase food production.\nThe victory of the Popular Front in the French elections raised great hopes among the Vietnamese in particular, with the appointment of Marius Moutet, former opponent of the repression that followed the Yen Bai mutiny as Minister of Colonies, as well as Léon Blum at the head of the government, who was also strongly opposed to colonial repression.\nBrévié has planned the implementation of social reforms similar to the one that he implemented in Africa, and the one implemented in Metropolitan France.
frenchindochina.1.a코0=Let's See What His Scientific Approach Will Bring
french_indochina_jules_brevie_governor_event_tt코0=Unlocks The §YPolitical Tree§!.

frenchindochina.2.t코0=1936 Strikes
frenchindochina.2.d코0=June saw the start of a major strike movement in Indochina, driven by a rise in prices added to the fall in wages that workers have been suffering for several years now. More than 300 of these movements have been recorded, involving hundreds of thousands of people up to the countryside where plantations are paralysed with farmers mobilizing against taxes. The result is an economy that has stopped abruptly and separatist movements that are taking advantage of it to gain popularity and spread independence ideas among the population.
frenchindochina.2.a코0=A solution must be found, and quickly!

r56.news_event.15.t코0=Vietnamese Uprising In Indochina
r56.news_event.15.d코0=While the whole of Indochina had already been paralyzed by strikes for several months, the government's failure to react contributed to the sharp rise in independence sentiment. The breaking point was reached when soldiers of the Indigenous Guard mutinied at Yen Bai.\n\nIt only took a few hours for the mutiny to turn into a general insurgency, covering the entire Vietnam region.\nThe multiple pro-independence forces have managed to consolidate their control in the north of the country, while in the south, the colonial government is preparing to counterattack against the greatest anti-colonial rebellion that Indochina has ever known.
r56.news_event.15.a코0=A fierce attack against colonialism
r56.news_event.15.b코0=We'll restore order to Indochina
r56.news_event.15.c코0=We'll remove the imperialists!

frenchindochina.4.t코0=The Indochinese Dilemna
frenchindochina.4.d코0=While German troops were occupying Paris, a new government, led by Marshal Pétain, had been put in place, claiming to be the legitimate French government, and having adopted a policy of collaboration with Germany.\nHowever, from London, the General De Gaulle called for resistance and to continue the fight against Germany, considering the government in Vichy as a traitor.\nWhile some colonies have already rallied De Gaulle, Indochina still remains nominally under the control of the government in Metropolitan France, but given the legitimacy of the latter, we could perfectly side with the troops of the general and prove to be decisive in terms of the supply of resources for the Free French troops.

frenchindochina.4.b코0=Side with Free France and appoint Thierry d'Argenlieu as Gouverneur

frenchindochina.5.t코0=Indochina Request More Troops
frenchindochina.5.d코0=Seeing how the war was evolving and fearing for the security of the colony, the Governor General of Indochina sent a message to the government, requesting additional troops and equipment to ensure the colony's security.\nSuch a material investment is not made carelessly, but we should not overlook the fact that Indochina is one of the most valuable and resource-rich colonies of France, and therefore we should consider carefully whether reducing our manpower in Europe would be worth the cost.
frenchindochina.5.a코0=We Must Strengthen Indochina's Protection!
frenchindochina.5.b코0=We Cannot Afford To Send Them More Troops

frenchindochina.6.t코0=France Sends Us Troops And Equipment
frenchindochina.6.d코0=The French government has agreed to send us troops and equipment to strengthen the defence of Indochina.\nThe latter have just arrived through the ports of Hanoi and Saigon, and are now under local command.
frenchindochina.6.a코0=Excellent!

frenchindochina.7.t코0=France Refuses To Send Troops
frenchindochina.7.d코0=Citing the situation in which the Métropole finds itself, and declaring that as many troops as possible should be under the command of the Métropole, the government in Paris refused to send the requested number of troops.
frenchindochina.7.a코0=We're Going To Have To Do With What We Have


frenchindochina.8.t코0=Vietnamese Uprising
frenchindochina.8.d코0=While the whole of Indochina had already been paralyzed by strikes for several months, the government's failure to react contributed to the sharp rise in independence sentiment. The breaking point was reached when soldiers of the Indigenous Guard mutinied at Yen Bai.\n\nIt only took a few hours for the mutiny to turn into a general insurgency, covering the entire Vietnam region.\nThe multiple pro-independence forces have managed to consolidate their control in the north of the country, while in the south, the colonial government is preparing to counterattack against the greatest anti-French rebellion that Indochina has ever known.
frenchindochina.8.a코0=We will prevail!




FRI_expand_the_michelin_plantations코0=Expand the Michelin Plantations
FRI_expand_the_michelin_plantations_desc코0=The agricultural concession policy put in place by former Governor General Jean-Marie de Lanessan saw the development of more than 400,000 hectares, and attracted a number of industrial groups, including the Michelin group, which acquired its first three rubber plantations in 1928. Since then, the latter have been among the most landowners in Indochina
FRI_finish_the_transindochinois코0=Finish The Transindochinois
FRI_finish_the_transindochinois_desc코0=The Transindochinois is a railway project linking Hanoi to Saigon. Started in 1905, the latter was opened in successive sections. It is time to complete the last few kilometres and finally connect the whole of Vietnam with a single railway line.
FRI_open_the_lycee_sisowath코0=Open The Lycée Sisowath
FRI_open_the_lycee_sisowath_desc코0=The spread of education was much slower in Cambodia and Laos than in Vietnam. While the first Cambodian secondary school was opened in 1893 under the name "Collège du Protectorat", secondary education has yet to be provided at the French lycée in Saigon. Developing secondary education will allow us to increase the efficiency of indigenous administration
FRI_continue_the_politique_politique_du_paysannat코0=Continue The Politique Du Paysannat
FRI_continue_the_politique_politique_du_paysannat_desc코0=The Politique du Paysannat is a policy designed to revive the agricultural economy of French Indochina, which consists of helping landowners, promoting the transition of farmers from lands in the north considered too overcrowded to those in the Mekong Delta, and finally an important hydraulic programme designed to develop the deltas in order to systematize the double harvest.
FRI_hlm_construction_program코0=HLM Construction Program
FRI_hlm_construction_program_desc코0=City workers often have to settle for rudimentary or even precarious housing, in straw huts or even at their workplace, which leads to a deplorable health situation. To address this, the authorities have launched a low-cost housing project to improve the overall quality of life in cities like Tonkin.
FRI_link_laos_to_annam코0=Link Laos To Annam
FRI_link_laos_to_annam_desc코0=In terms of infrastructure, Laos is the most neglected of the regions, with only about ten kilometres of asphalted roads. However, a highway will be built to link it to the Annam coast by crossing the Mekong River to improve its connection with the rest of the settlements.
FRI_tonkin_cement_factories코0=Tonkin Cement Factories
FRI_tonkin_cement_factories_desc코0=Cochinchina and Tonkin are the most economically dynamic regions in Indochina. In addition to its many mines, Tonkin is famous for its cement production. Financial assistance to companies that produce them would allow us to increase our exports of this product.
FRI_explore_the_laotian_underground코0=Explore The Laotian Underground
FRI_explore_the_laotian_underground_desc코0=Laos is still relatively undeveloped economically, but thanks to the expansion of its infrastructure, we could exploit its basements containing particularly tin.
FRI_expand_the_laotian_distilleries코0=Expand The Laotian Distilleries
FRI_expand_the_laotian_distilleries_desc코0=A good way to expand the Laotian economy would be to increase the number of distilleries, which would be used to produce rice alchools that we could then sell on the Asian market.
FRI_balanced_economic_developement코0=Balanced Economic Developement
FRI_balanced_economic_development코0=Balanced Economic Development
FRI_balanced_economic_development_desc코0=The excessive importance of Vietnamese regions in the global economy of Indochina may prove dangerous in view of the rise of nationalist movements. Making Laos and Cambodia, both regions much more loyal to France, equal regions in terms of economic power is the key.
PRI_continue_the_focus_on_vietnam코0=Continue The Focus On Vietnam
PRI_continue_the_focus_on_vietnam_desc코0=Vietnam remains the most profitable region for all Indochina because of its much more easily cultivated land. The region already has many small businesses, it would not be complicated to develop a heavier industry there.
FRI_move_vietnamese_workers_to_laos코0=Move Vietnamese Workers To Laos
FRI_move_vietnamese_workers_to_laos_desc코0=The Vietnamese already constitute the high and average level of the bureaucracy in Laos. By encouraging Vietnamese workers to settle in cities like Vientiane or Thakhek, we will increase the skilled labour available in this region that can exploit it economically.
FRI_expand_the_opium_trade코0=Expand The Opium Trade
FRI_expand_the_opium_trade_desc코0=Although illegal in mainland France, the culture of Opium and its exchange have always brought great benefits to the Indochinese economy. We could probably take advantage of the chaos in China to increase our exports of this plant.
FRI_increase_the_taxes코0=Increase The Taxes
FRI_increase_the_taxes_desc코0=Our project to develop the economy of regions as backward as Cambodia and Laos requires a substantial budget, the benefits of which we will only see after a while. A first way to raise the necessary funds would be to increase taxes on the local population.
FRI_vietnamese_private_armament_business코0=Vietnamese Private Armament Business
FRI_vietnamese_private_armament_business_desc코0=Over the years, Vietnamese private small and medium-sized enterprises continue to grow. The arms industry has proved to be a very successful sector, and financial support from the administration for both personal and professional arms companies could be very lucrative.
FRI_open_the_university_of_phnom_penh코0=Open The University Of Phnom Penh
FRI_open_the_university_of_vientiane코0=Open The Université Française De Vientiane
FRI_open_the_university_of_vientiane_desc코0=Like its Cambodian neighbour, education is relatively underdeveloped in Laos, with more than 80% of the population illiterate. This creates a shortage of qualified staff for positions such as administration. The opening of a school covering higher education will increase the number of qualified graduates for these positions.
FRI_build_the_phnom_penh_arsenal코0=Build The Phnom Penh Arsenal
FRI_build_the_phnom_penh_arsenal_desc코0=The production of firearms is relatively low in Indochina, due to the supply from the Métropole in terms of equipment. The development of a military-industrial complex could, however, prove very lucrative in the underdeveloped region of Cambodia, which would see its economic potential significantly increased with the possibility of exporting these same weapons to the same markets where we sell our rice. 
FRI_expand_the_tungsten_mines코0=Expand The Tungsten Mines
FRI_expand_the_tungsten_mines_desc코0=Vietnamese basements are full of minerals, and among them, tungsten. The increase in global armaments needs means that this resource is becoming increasingly popular on the markets, so it would be in our interest to start work to expand the mines we already own.
FRI_invite_investors_to_kouang_tcheou_wan코0=Invite Investors To Kouang-Tchéou-Wan
FRI_invite_investors_to_kouang_tcheou_wan_desc코0=The economy of Kouang-Tcheou-Wan is relatively underdeveloped, and the population lives largely from agriculture. However, the tranquility of the city has attracted many Chinese investors, and we hope to eventually turn it into a new Hong Kong if we allocate enough funds to it.
FRI_the_indochinese_merchant_marine코0=The Indochinese Merchant Marine
FRI_the_indochinese_merchant_marine_desc코0=Our navy is largely composed of commercial ships throughout Asia. Developing our production capacities for these same vessels would allow us to accelerate the transport of our goods.
FRI_expand_the_fort_bayard_infrastructures코0=Expand The Fort-Bayard Infrastructures
FRI_expand_the_fort_bayard_infrastructures_desc코0=Fort-Bayard traffic is much lower than we expected. In part, this is due to its location, which is far too remote from major maritime trade flows. We could try to stimulate the city's economy by developing its infrastructure to compensate for the lack of foreign trade in order to connect it to the rest of South China.
FRI_the_french_hong_kong코0=The French Hong Kong
FRI_the_french_hong_kong_desc코0=France has long hoped to make Kouang-Tcheou-Wan a French Hong Kong capable of competing with it. It is time to put these projects back in place and develop the commercial capacity of this territory.
FRI_focus_on_the_vietnamese_ports코0=Focus On The Vietnamese Ports
FRI_focus_on_the_vietnamese_ports_desc코0=Kouang-Tcheou-Wan turns out to be a waste of time and resources because of its highly restrictive location. We should focus our efforts on the development of the ports of Haiphong and Saigon, which are already making a significant contribution to Indochina's economic dynamism.
FRI_trade_protection_doctrine코0=Trade Protection Doctrine
FRI_trade_protection_doctrine_desc코0=The risk of Japanese invasion is significant. However, their weakness is the need for them to import a large part of their resources. By focusing on the destruction of convoys and a global disruption of trade, we shall starve their navy.
FRI_trade_disturbtion_doctrine코0=Trade Disturbtion Doctrine
FRI_trade_disturbtion_doctrine_desc코0=The risk of Japanese invasion is significant. However, their weakness is the need for them to import a large part of their resources. By focusing on the destruction of convoys and a global disruption of trade, we shall starve their navy.
FRI_invite_fcm_to_fort_bayard코0=Invite FCM To Fort Bayard
FRI_invite_fcm_to_fort_bayard_desc코0=Forges et chantiers de la Méditerranée is renowned for its shipyards in the Mediterranean. We could invite them to build new dockyards at Fort-Bayrd, transforming a commercial city into a real industrial centre for our navy.
FRI_invite_fcm_to_fort_bayard_tt코0=Unlocks §YFCM§! As A Ship Designer
FRI_submarines_effort코0=Submarines Effort
FRI_submarines_effort_desc코0=An excellent way to disrupt trade would be to use submarines, which is excellent when it comes to getting rid of convoys. In addition, their ability to remain discreet can also be used against large vessels, which are very present in the Japanese fleet.
FRI_expand_the_garde_indigene코0=Expand The Garde Indigène
FRI_expand_the_garde_indigene_desc코0=The "Garde Indigène" refers to the regiments of skirmishers recruited in Indochina, supported by French officers and non-commissioned officers. Their numbers have been steadily increasing since their creation in 1886, and with the rise of nationalism in Indochina, we should seek to increase their numbers to better support the colonial government.
FRI_adopt_the_mas_36코0=Adopt The MAS36
FRI_adopt_the_mas_36_desc코0=The MAS36 is gradually beginning to equip the French army. We will ask for some of these rifles to be sent to Indochina and their plans in order to eventually produce them ourselves on site.
FRI_adopt_the_mas_36_tt코0=Add technology: §YMAS-36§!\nIf we already have it: §Y1x §!§G100%§! Research bonus for: §YInfantry Weapons§!\n
FRI_improve_communications코0=Improve Communications
FRI_improve_communications_desc코0=Due to the very hostile nature of the jungles of Indochina, communication between troops can be very complex. The development of radio for our troops would partially alleviate this problem.
FRI_establish_the_armee_d_indochine코0=Establish The Armée D'Indochine
FRI_establish_the_armee_d_indochine_desc코0=We cannot simply rely on the Armée de Terre to protect Indochina, especially if we find ourselves at war on both the European and Asian fronts. We will establish a real Indochinese army to protect the colony ourselves.
FRI_maintain_reliance_on_the_armee_de_terre코0=Maintain Reliance On The Armee De Terre
FRI_maintain_reliance_on_the_armee_de_terre_desc코0=The Armée de Terre is well enough to defend Indochina. We should focus our efforts on developing our fortifications and military installations.
FRI_allow_indigenous_officers코0=Allow Indigenous Officers
FRI_allow_indigenous_officers_desc코0=Our new army will be mainly composed of indigenous people, and thus we should employ officers of Indochineses origins to support us.
FRI_indochinese_military_service코0=Indochinese Military Service
FRI_indochinese_military_service_desc코0=Similar to the one present in France, a compulsory military service will be set up throughout Indochina in order to have a sufficient reserve of conscripted soldiers.
FRI_ecole_militaire_de_hanoi코0=Ecole Militaire De Hanoi
FRI_ecole_militaire_de_hanoi_desc코0=Taking the famous Saint-Cyr school as an example, we will also create a military school to train the next generation of Indochinese officers.
VIN_build_the_ligne_sarrault코0=Build The Ligne Sarrault
VIN_build_the_ligne_sarrault_desc코0=The construction of a fortification line in the north of the country, on the Chinese border, would protect us from any attempt at land invasion by the latter or Japan.
FRI_create_coastal_fortifications코0=Create Coastal Fortifications
FRI_create_coastal_fortifications_desc코0=The construction of naval fortifications to protect our precious Vietnamese and Chinese ports would allow us to limit the possibilities of invasion by the sea.
FRI_create_coastal_fortifications_tt코0=Creates §YLevel 2 Forts§! On Our Ports
FRI_expand_the_northern_air_bases코0=Expand The Northern Air Bases
FRI_expand_the_northern_air_bases_desc코0=Our capacity to accommodate French aircraft is quite low, with only small aerodromes. If we want to ensure that France can protect our skies, we should expand our aviation facilities.
FRI_gouverneur_jules_brevie코0=Appoint Jules Brévié
FRI_gouverneur_jules_brevie_desc코0=The victory of the [FRA.GetRulingParty] meant a great change for Indochina, but above all it meant a replacement of René Robin by Jules Brévié as Governor General of Indochina. Brévié, a socialist, is in favour of a scientific approach to colonization, and hopes to implement many reforms aimed at improving the quality of life in Indochina.
FRI_gouverneur_jules_brevie_tt코0=§MJules Brévie Will Become Gouverneur Général In September 1936§!\n
FRI_concessions_to_the_strikers코0=Concessions To Laborers
FRI_concessions_to_the_strikers_desc코0=The economic recovery of 1936 caused prices to soar in Indochina, even though workers had already been suffering from a decline in wages for years. If we do not wish to see the colonial administration collapse, we will accelerate the reforms planned by [FRI.Getleader]
FRI_expansion_of_the_strikes코0=Expansion Of The Strikes
FRI_expansion_of_the_strikes_desc코0=In these difficult times, with the economic crisis that continues to hit our economy, we cannot afford any concessions to the local population. Let us hope that the strikes will stop on their own....
FRI_amnesty_law코0=Amnesty For Independentists
FRI_expansion_of_the_strikes_tt코0=Not Finished Yet
FRI_amnesty_law_desc코0=A first step towards reconciliation with the independence fighters would be to show our good will by freeing them. An amnesty law that is supposed to release more than 90% of them will be promulgated.
FRI_decret_moutet코0=Moutet Decree
FRI_decret_moutet_desc코0=The Minister of Colonies, Marius Moutet, had a decree signed equivalent to an Indochinese labour code, and similar to the many social laws that were promulgated in metropolitan areas under the Popular Front. The daily working hours will be reduced and night work for women and children will be prohibited.
FRI_freedom_of_speech_and_association코0=Freedom Of Speech And Association
FRI_freedom_of_speech_and_association_desc코0=It is true that there has always been some repression against certain intellectual groups in Indochina. But it is time to change things, by allowing full freedom of expression and freedom of association, allowing for example the formation of trade unions.
FRI_gain_support_from_the_kuomintang코0=Gain Support From The Kuomintang
FRI_gain_support_from_the_kuomintang_desc코0=The Kuomintang has long been an ally of the VNQDD, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. The Yunnan railway would allow us to acquire material and political support, allowing exiles to return from the north to help us form the insurgency.
FRI_gain_support_from_the_soviet_union코0=Gain Support From The Soviet Union
FRI_gain_support_from_the_soviet_union_desc코0=The strategy of the popular fronts advocated by the Soviet Union has led the Indochinese Communist Party to agree to move closer to the other elements of the independence movement. Leaders like Nguyen Ai Quoc will be of great help because of the strong increase in popularity for communist movements in Vietnam, especially in Cochinchina.
FRI_the_second_yen_bai_mutiny코0=The Second Yen Bai Mutiny
FRI_the_second_yen_bai_mutiny_desc코0=A mutiny by the various Indochinese rifle regiments will be the starting point of our war of independence. A similar mutiny took place in 1930 but did not receive the support it hoped for, but now, with the support of millions of strikers in all regions, we should have much less difficulty getting rid of the French presence.
FRI_the_second_yen_bai_mutiny_tt코0=You will switch to §YVietnam§!, and §RDeclare War§! on §YFrench Indochina§!.\nIf you manage to take control of the whole of Indochina or hold on for more than a year by controlling the whole of your territory, a §GWhite Peace§! will take place and you will be free.\nDuring the war of independence, a §RPower Struggle§! will take place between four §YFactions§!, which will determine §YVietnam§!'s ideology once the war of independence is over.\nIf you take control of §YLaos§! and §YCambodia§!, they will also be liberated once the war is over.\n
FRI_allow_political_parties코0=Allow Political Parties
FRI_allow_political_parties_desc코0=The formation of moderate political parties will be allowed. Two have already emerged and are mainly intended to represent the Indochinese bourgeoisie: the Constitutionalist Party and the Democratic Party. The latter only aspire to a certain autonomy for Indochina, similar to the British dominions.
FRI_bring_back_stability코0=Bring Back Stability
FRI_expand_the_surete_generale_indochinoise코0=Expand The Sûreté Générale Indochinoise
FRI_expand_the_surete_generale_indochinoise_desc코0=The Indochinese General Security Service is a repressive apparatus that has existed in Indochina since 1917 and is dedicated to countering the rise of Vietnamese nationalism. An effort to increase its membership will allow us to prevent such strikes from paralysing the colonial administration once again.
FRI_crackdown_on_communist_organisations코0=Revolutionnary Crackdown
FRI_crackdown_on_communists_organisations코0=Revolutionnary Crackdown
FRI_crackdown_on_communists_organisations_desc코0=Vietnamese communist movements, although banned, continue to gain popularity, especially among urban workers. A mass arrest of its leaders still present in Indochina should halt their progress.
FRI_fuelling_the_metropole코0=Fuelling The Métropole
FRI_fuelling_the_metropole_desc코0=Our role is above all to support the Métropole economically. As the war has just broken out, all our resources must be dedicated to supporting the war effort in terms of resources such as rubber or agrarian resources such as rice or tea.
FRI_fuelling_the_metropole_tt코0=If we are not on §YWar Economy§! or §YTotal Mobilization§!, changes the economy law to §YWar Economy§!\n
FRI_plan_mandel코0=Plan Mandel
FRI_plan_mandel_desc코0=The Mandel Plan, named after the colonial minister who replaced Moutet, consists of mobilizing more than 300,000 colonial workers, including 100,000 Indochinese, to be sent to Metropolitan France to run the French war economy and in particular its factories.
FRI_vientiane_phnom_penh_railroad코0=Vientiane-Phnom Penh Railroad
FRI_expand_the_transindochinois코0=Expand The Transindochinois
FRI_expand_the_transindochinois_desc코0=Linking Phnom Penh and Vientiane to Transindochinois would allow us to have a single railway line that would connect the whole of Indochina. This would make it easier for us to exploit the Laotian and Cambodian resources.
FRI_mimic_the_marine_nationale코0=Mimic The Marine Nationale
FRI_mimic_the_marine_nationale_desc코0=The development of a naval armed force controlled by the Indochinese colonial government rather than by France itself would allow us to build a navy much more adapted to the waters of Southeast Asia. But we must not forget our roots and we will base ourselves on the navy that we know best, the French one.
FRI_fleet_in_being_doctrine코0=Fleet In Being Doctrine
FRI_fleet_in_being_doctrine_desc코0=Above all, we must ensure that our merchant ships can reach port, and to do so, we should focus on building medium and heavy ships and in particular destroyers to counter attacks by submarines which, although not much used by the Japanese army, could be formidable even in small numbers.
FRI_destroyers_modernisation_desc코0=To implement our submarine defence plans, we need to upgrade the destroyers in our navy to ensure that no submarines reach our convoys.
FRI_destroyers_modernisation코0=Destroyers Modernisation
FRI_the_return_of_cuong_de코0=The Return Of Cuong De
FRI_the_return_of_cuong_de_desc코0=Cuong De is a member of the Nguyen dynasty who should, according to the law of Primogeniture, have inherited the Vietnamese throne. He has spent more than two decades travelling in Asia in the hope of obtaining support for Vietnamese independence, and has many links with Japanese ultra-nationalists. Rumours of an insurrection have reached him, and he is preparing to return to his native land....

FRI_tirailleurs_indochinois코0=Tirailleurs Indochinois
FRI_tirailleurs_indochinois_desc코0=Recruited throughout Indochina, the Tirailleurs Indochinois were created in 1880 during the Tonkin expedition. The latter allowed France to maintain its authority over the Indochinese colony and to crush all nationalist rebellions.

VIN_request_the_mortier_modele_27_31코0=Request The Mortier Modèle 27/31
VIN_request_the_mortier_modele_27_31_desc코0=The Mortar model 27/31, designed and manufactured by Brandt Establishments, has already been in service in France for several years. Simple to use but formidable on the ground, equipping our colonial force with it would allow a much better defence of cities like Saigon or Hanoi in the event of a ground invasion, the latter being placed on rather flat ground.
FRI_the_mortier_modele_27_31코0=The Mortier Modèle 27/31
FRI_the_mortier_modele_27_31_desc코0=The Mortar model 27/31, designed and manufactured by Brandt Establishments, has already been in service in France for several years.

FRI_tame_the_forests코0=Tame The Forests
FRI_tame_the_forests_desc코0=Many forests are scattered throughout Indochina, making fighting much more difficult, especially for an army that would not know the area. This can be used to our advantage, allowing us to better prepare our defenses through our extensive knowledge of the environment.
FRI_tame_the_forests_tt코0=Enables §HForest Training§!\n§HInfantry\n    Forest§!\n      Attack: §G+5%§!\n      Movement: §G+10%§!\n

FRI_fortify_the_chinese_border코0=Fortify The Chinese Border

FRI_parachutistes_coloniaux코0=Parachutistes Coloniaux

FRI_intensify_native_recruitment코0=Intensify Native Recruitement
FRI_intensify_native_recruitment_desc코0=France needs as many soldiers as possible. As during the Great War, the colonies proved to be the ideal place to recruit future soldiers.
FRI_independent_command_structure코0=Independent Command Structure
FRI_independent_command_structure_desc코0=While maintaining an allegance and affiliation with the Armée de Terre, the Indochinese army must be independent in terms of strategies and decisions of generals and officers.
FRI_from_militias_to_an_army코0=From Militias To An Army
FRI_from_militias_to_an_army_desc코0=The Indigenous Guard is more like militias under government control than a real army. It is time to reorganize them into real divisions in order to allow the Indochina army to be sufficiently organized.

FRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC코0=A true pearl of the French colonial empire, Indochina is the most profitable French colony. Intended mainly for economic exploitation through its many raw materials, the French presence is rather weak, and the administration relies mainly on support from the indigenous elites, supported by the famous Indochinese riflemen.\n\nThe French presence has always been challenged, the most recent uprising being the Yen Bai mutiny in 1930. The economic devastation caused by the Great Depression could very well lead to a new wave of protest.
