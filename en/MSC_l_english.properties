newsmod.2.t코0=Japan And France Enter Military Alliance
newsmod.2.d코0=Initiated by the French, Japan and France have just announced their intent to sign a military alliance between the two countries.

newsmod.2.a코0=We welcome them!
newsmod.2.b코0=Excellent.
newsmod.2.c코0=The plot thickens.
newsmod.3.t코0=Germany Accepts British Empire Into Axis
newsmod.3.d코0=This past year, ultra-nationalist fascist movements exploded in Britain. The democratic way of life has become a minority as the nation embraces fascism. What's more - the British have decided to join in an alliance with Hitler and the German Reich, threatening the stability of Europe. The Dominions have also been forced to join the Axis, but they are reluctant and feel the time has come to distance themselves from Britain....
newsmod.3.a코0=A true turning point in our history!
newsmod.3.b코0=We welcome our British friends!
newsmod.3.c코0=We do not agree to this!

newsmod.4.d코0=Initiated by the Italians, Germany and Italy have just announced their intent to sign a military alliance between the two countries, a "Rome-Berlin Axis." As the two main fascist regimes in Europe, it was to be expected, but what could this alliance have been made for? Some speculate they are preparing for war.
newsmod.4.a코0=The Germans are our natural ally!
newsmod.4.b코0=The Italians may prove useful.
newsmod.4.c코0=This is a threat to peace in Europe.
newsmod.5.t코0=Italy and Allied Powers White Peace
newsmod.5.d코0=The Duce and Allied Powers have just announced a white peace. Italy will refrain from any further fighting against the Allies and has withdrawn from the Axis. Can the Reich continue this fight alone?

Members of the Italian Communist Party orchestrated a bloody assassination not just for the Duce but many prominent leaders of the fascist regime. Reports say the Duce was warned against holding the parade in Milan, as northern Italy has a huge amount of communist sympathizers. When suggested to move the annual parade to Naples instead, the Duce refused. WIth Mussolini dead, the state of Italian politics has once again turned chaotic as armed communists seize positions in government and call for a full overthrowing of the fascist regime.

newsmod.8.b코0=Welcome, comrades!
newsmod.8.c코0=Worrying.
newsmod.9.t코0=Pope Expelled From Italy
newsmod.9.d코0=With the assassination of Mussolini and the deposition of King Emmanuel III, it was only a matter of time until the Pope became the next target. The communists leaders have decided to expel the Papacy and annex the Vatican. The Pope has fled and now obtains refuge in southern France.
newsmod.9.a코0=This archaic cult has seen its last hour.
newsmod.9.b코0=This certainly doesn't help the general political climate.
newsmod.10.t코0=King Emmanuel III Deposed!
newsmod.10.d코0=With Mussolini dead and the fascists waning power, the leaders of [ITA.GetName] have decided the time has come to depose King Emmanuel III.
