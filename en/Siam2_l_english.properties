# Events
siam.1.t코0=The Nonthaburi Speech
siam.1.d코0=Pridi Banomyong, a member of the civilian wing of Khana Ratsadon, known for his radical ideas, sometimes close to Marxism, of land reforms, addressed today a speech in the city of Nonthaburi.\n"Dear people of Siam, our glorious revolution, which has made us transition from a decadent and outdated political system to a system where the people finally have their voice, seems to be undergoing a test today. I myself have noticed that within the same party from which I come, some elements would like to establish their own form of tyranny, with the difference that the King and the nobles would be replaced by Generals and soliders. But I believe in the Siamese people, who will never let such a thing happen. We have defeated tyranny once, we shall defeat it again."\nMany believe that this speech was about Phraya Phahonphonphonphayuhasena, who became Prime Minister following a coup d'état against the former Prime Minister, Phraya Manopakorn Nititada, of whom Pridi was close, but who was accused of communism because of his reform plans. No one knows if this speech will have an impact or not, but we will have to keep an eye on Pridi
siam.1.a코0=What Kind Of Damage Could A Simple Teacher Cause?


siam.2.t코0=Radio Seriphaph
siam.2.d코0=It seems that the Free Thai have managed to take control of a radio station in the north of the country, where they have the most control. They use it to broadcast their own radio, Radio Seriphaph, meaning "Radio Freedom", with virulent attacks against the regime, as well as a call to join them every time. Some of their broadcasts are also linked to the debate on how Siam should be reorganized once the government is defeated, where there is a clear schism between the Liberals and the Communists, who seem to be equal in terms of membership within the rebels.
siam.2.a코0=We Need To Shut It Down!

siam.3.t코0=Ho-Chi-Minh's Invitation
siam.3.d코0=Since the beginning of the process of drafting a new constitution for Siam, some members of the temporary government have expressed their admiration for the person of Ho-Chi-Minh, a famous Vietnamese revolutionary, whose struggle for Vietnam's independence has been compared many times to the struggle against Khana Ratsadon. Many have expressed their desire to be advised by the one considered to be the greatest and wisest Indochinese revolutionary.\nHowever, more moderate members expressed mistrust, citing the link between Ho and communism, and fearing that a visit on his part would lead a large part of the government and the population to want to adopt a revolution modelled on that of the Bolsheviks.
siam.3.a코0=Welcome, Uncle Ho!
siam.3.b코0=We can't risk his presence

siam.4.t코0=The Red March
siam.4.d코0=It would seem that the simple transition to a parliamentary system was not enough. While it was supposed to be just another Monday, the Communist Party of Siam made a gigantic call for a revolt against capitalism, encouraging the inhabitants to seize the means of production by themselves. Pridi Phonmayong, who has since become the main thinker of the Communist Party, addressed a major speech to the crowd, stating that Siam now belongs to the workers.\nSeni Pramoj, seeing the extent of the protests, but refusing to follow the communist system, was forced to resign, and it is said that he took a plane with his family to the United States. Phonmayong, said the Communist Party of Siam single party and announced the establishment of a new political system \"More suited to our revolution\"
siam.4.a코0=Long Live The Revolution!

siam.5.t코0=The Declaration of the Republic
siam.5.d코0=Direk Jayanama, Head of the Provisional Government, addressed the crowd in Bangkok today, gathered to attend his first speech as Head of Government.\n\"People of Siam, the blood of many of your brothers had to flow so that the rest of you could live in peace, and live free. It is for freedom that they fought and sacrificed themselves, and it is for these values that we shall honour them. People of Siam, freedom has triumphed over the darkness of tyranny, and I am proud to announce that we will build a republic based on our values for which we have proven our courage\".
siam.5.a코0=Long live the Republic!

siam.6.t코0=A Weapon Warehouse Raided!
siam.6.d코0=During the night, one of our main weapons warehouses, located not far from Bangkok, was attacked by rebels, identified as belonging to the Free Thais. It would appear that most of the guards were killed discreetly, as the alarm was never triggered, which also implied that there had to be an ally among the guards. The warehouse was completely emptied, taking rifle and ammunition with them.
siam.6.a코0=This Does Not Bode Well...

siam.7.t코0=A Letter From Pridi
siam.7.d코0=One of the army generals went to Prime Minister Phot Phahonyothin to tell him of his fears about a potential infiltration of the army by anti-government revolutionaries. He claims to have found in one of the dormitories a message written by Pridi Banomyong. This message encouraged soldiers to peacefully oppose the government, declaring their refusal to be commanded by what they call "an adaptation of fascism".\nThe general suggested using this letter as a justification to arrest Pridi Banomyong for inciting disorder, and to try to prevent ideas of rebellion from spreading
siam.7.a코0=We'll Show Him What We Do To Pseudo-Revolutionaries

siam.8.t코0=The Sakhrai Incident
siam.8.d코0=Last night, a police station in a village in the north-eastern district of Sakhrai was attacked by a gang of ten armed men. The two police officers present apparently disappeared, killed or abducted, and the attackers left the scene a few minutes later, according to a witness who had managed not to be seen. He says he heard one of the men complain about the absence of an official radio station.\nThe news of this attack provoked many reactions within the government, some thinking that they could have been inspired by Pridi Banomyong's call for resistance, which the authorities are still looking for but which remains unaccounted for. Rumours are circulating that a vast resistance network is being set up, and Phraya Phahonphonphonphayuhasena has announced his intention to increase the number of police officers in the region.
siam.8.a코0=Hopefully It Was Only An Isolated Act

siam.9.t코0=The Free Thais
siam.9.d코0=While it was only supposed to be one afternoon like any other, a very special message could be heard on military radio:\n"We are the Free Thai movement. The soldiers of Khana Ratsadon are traitors, who used the revolution to make their own tyranny prevail instead of that of the King. We want to bring justice and democracy to our nation, and we will not hesitate in any way to finally give the Siamese people freedom. If you are an ally of the government, you are our enemy. If you are against it, you are our ally. We do not want to hurt any innocent people, but to prevent our beautiful nation from falling into the trap of fascism. We have seen what happened in Italy, Germany or Hungary. Terror, hatred, fanaticism and despair reign. We want to avoid this fate for our beautiful country, and build a new government that would act with the intention of meeting the needs of the people, for we are the people."\nThe voice heard was none other than that of Direk Jayanama, another former member of the Khana Ratsadon's civilian wing, who had become one of the main critics of the manhunt against Pridi Banomyong. It seems that he has decided to join the latter in an attempt to bring down the government through a large-scale revolt. We are currently unaware of their numbers, and it seems that they are mainly hiding in the northeast of the country, making it difficult to track them down.
siam.9.a코0=Then We Shall Wage War Against Them!

siam.10.t코0=The Dibabha Rebellion
siam.10.d코0=What should have been a simple insurection has turned into a real rebellion. Declaring that he had found a letter from the Prime Minister to several members of Khana Ratsadon, indicating his ambitions to abolish the monarchy in the coming months, Prince Aditya Dibabha, who had been regent on behalf of Rama VIII, made a great appeal to the rebellion to "all those still loyal to the king". Many thought it would be crushed in the same way as Prince Boworadet's 1933 rebellion, which had failed because the Bangkok garrisons refused to join him.\nBut this time it was not the case. The garrison immediately left to join the rebels, who were able to take control of Bangkok within a few hours.\nThe main members of the former government, in particular Phraya Phahonphonphonphayuhasena, the Prime Minister, and Plaek Phibunsongkhram, were arrested and are awaiting trial, and the Prince declared the abolition of the 1932 Constitution, and his intention to restore Rama VII as King of Siam, declaring his abdication invalid due to military pressure.

siam.11.t코0=The Battle Of Bangkok
siam.11.d코0=The final battle against the regime is launched. Following the "Declaration of Revolt", issued by Pridi Banomyong himself to all Free Thais from Radio Seriphaph, the vast majority of rebels converged on Bangkok, hoping to take control of the government authorities. Two thirds of the militias attacked the city from the north, while the rest came from the east, with a small group apparently trying to attack from the ports using boats obtained as a result of a navy mutiny. Meanwhile, the government-loyal army, led by Plaek Phibunsongkhram, has deployed in the city, where a curfew has been decreed until further notice, and the aircraft is preparing to take off to provide reconnaissance support. The fate of Siam will be decided in the next few days...
siam.11.a코0=Let's End This!

siam.12.t코0=The Return Of Rama VII
siam.12.d코0=Rama VII, who was still in exile in Europe, agreed to return to Siam and regain his throne. When he arrived at Bangkok airport, a huge crowd awaited him, chanting slogans to the glory of the king and the monarchy. Prince Aditya Dibabha, Head of the Provisional Government, was also present and accompanied Rama VII until the coronation ceremony a few hours later.\nRama VII is therefore once again king of Siam, and has announced his intention to re-implement the reforms he had put in place before the 1932 coup, notably the Supreme Council, and his intention to set up greater decentralization of the administration.
siam.12.a코0=Long Live Rama VII!
SIA_monarchy_party코0=Chakri Dynasty
SIA_monarchy_party_long코0=Chakri Dynasty

siam.13.t코0=The Monarchy Question
siam.13.d코0=Officially, Siam has been a constitutional monarchy since the 1932 coup d'état, and the king continues to have some power over the government. But since the abdication of Prajadhipok, also known as Rama VII, following disagreement with the military who had become the main force of politics, Siam found itself without a king. His successor, Ananda Mahidol or Rama VIII, is only a child studying in Switzerland, and his regents have only a very limited influence. However, some members of the government fear that in the long term, the new king would risk putting batons in the wheels of the military again, and have therefore suggested abolishing the monarchy. But the abolition of an institution as important as the monarchy should not be taken lightly...
siam.13.a코0=For The Good Of The Country, It Must Be Kept
siam.13.b코0=We No Longer Need It

siam.14.t코0=Constitutional Restoration Of Rama VII
siam.14.d코0=Following a popular referendum in which more than half of the people decided to restore King Rama VII to his throne, he arrived at Bangkok airport two days later, welcomed by Prime Minister Seni Pramoj. A few hours later, his coronation ceremony took place, having sworn to respect the limits imposed by the new Siamese constitution.
siam.14.a코0=Long Live The King! Long Live The Constitution!

siam.15.t코0=Victory Of The Rebels!
siam.15.d코0=The Battle of Bangkok raged for days on end, with guns and rifles never stopping firing, soldiers and rebels fighting from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. Following the takeover of the National Assembly building, the last government forces agreed to lay down their arms. According to some soldiers, Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who commanded the anti-revolutionary troops, chose to commit suicide rather than witness the defeat of his own forces. Phraya Phahonphonphonphayuhasena, the former Prime Minister, apparently managed to take a ship and flee to Cambodia. Pridi Banomyong, leader of the revolutionaries, addressed a speech on the radio.\n\"Dear people of Siam, military tyranny is now behind us. The people have shown that, despite all the repression and fighting, they can maintain their determination and defeat the oppressor. From now on, power will be handed over to the people, the peasant, the worker, they will finally be liberated. We are at the dawn of the new era, we are walking towards a bright and hopeful future\"
siam.15.a코0=Hurray For The Revolution!

siam.16.t코0=The Creation of the Socialist Republic of Siam
siam.16.d코0=It is now time to officially declare Siam as a Republic that will follow Socialist thought. What Lenin has achieved in Russia, we will achieve here in Siam, we will build a new nation, free from the chains of capitalism.
siam.16.a코0=The Red Star Rises On Siam
siam.18.t코0=Plaek Phibunsongkhram Elected Prime Minister
siam.18.d코0=It seems that Phraya Phahonphonphonphayuhasena is no longer in a position to lead the country. A scandal has just struck him: he reportedly sold royal goods to officers at much lower prices than usual. In addition, its supporters found themselves in a minority in the Popular Assembly following the first direct elections. Finally, his cabinet was unable to pass a budget reform, and collapsed. New elections have been held, and Plaek Phibunsongkhram has been chosen to lead the country
siam.18.a코0=A Man With Great Ambitions

siam.19.t코0=Rebels Occupie Isan
siam.19.d코0=The Free Thais rebels launched a major offensive in Isan, and succeeded in capturing the important city of Nakhon Ratchasima, the largest in the region. Now bordering Laos, many fear that the rebels will try to establish links with Pathet Lao, or even the Việt Minh.\nPlaek Phibunsongkhram, Minister of Defence, suggested using reconnaissance to locate their main bases and then bombarding them from the air to affect their morals, but an action like this on our own soil and people could have very strong repercussions....

siam.20.t코0=Pridi Banomyong Killed By The Air Raids
siam.20.d코0=Our air raid over Isan managed to damage two of the rebel training camps, but also what seemed to be their headquarters. This morning, on Radio Seriphaph, Direk Jayanama announced that Pridi Banomyong had been killed by the air raids, and that it was up to him to "Complete the task that this great man will see us accomplish from heaven" The loss of the rebel leader does not seem to have diminished their morale, even worse, it is said that many farmers have decided to join them following the loss of their cultures following the air raids which caused many fires
siam.20.a코0=We Cut One Head, And Two Grow Back!

siam.21.t코0=Insurrection In Indochina!
siam.21.d코0=Communist rebel groups have seized a large part of Indochina's cities! Probably helped by Siam's communist neighbour, the latter sought to drive out the French colonial administration. It is time to restore the order...

siam.23.t코0=Victory Of The Rebels!
siam.23.d코0=The Battle of Bangkok raged for days on end, with guns and rifles never stopping firing, soldiers and rebels fighting from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. Following the takeover of the National Assembly building, the last government forces agreed to lay down their arms. According to some soldiers, Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who commanded the anti-revolutionary troops, chose to commit suicide rather than witness the defeat of his own forces.

siam.23.a코0=Hurray For The Revolution!

siam.24.t코0=Election Day
siam.24.d코0=Today is the day of the general election that will determine the first government of the new Republic. Two candidates are among the most likely choices. Direk Jayanama, leader of the Seri Thais following the death of Pridi, who founded the \"People's Radical Party\", taking as an example the French Radicalism as well as the policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who wants to set up a state intervention in the economy to guarantee the well-being of the people. On the other hand, Seni Pramoj, another member of the Seri Thais, founded the conservative \"Democratic Party\", Seni himself being of royal heritage, he would like to restore the monarchy, while limiting it much more than what the first revolutionaries had done in 1932. Economically, he is much closer to Brittanic Tories, and believes that a non-interventionist economic policy would be beneficial to the nation and the people.
siam.24.a코0=The People's Radical Party
siam.24.b코0=The Democratic Party
siam.25.t코0=Siam Asks For Help
siam.25.d코0=The ambassador of Siam had brought with him a very special letter, intended exclusively for [SOV.GetLeader]. This letter explained the Siamese government's plan to support communist movements opposing the French colonisation of Indochina.\nThe letter concludes with a call for help from Siam, explaining that by its low industrial capacity compared to ours, the shipment of weapons and equipment is slow and very expensive, and they hope that we will send them equipment to spread communist ideals in Indochina.

siam.28.a코0=At Least They Stick To Their \"Socialism In One Country\"

siam.29.t코0=Trial Of Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena
siam.29.d코0=The first member of the Khana Ratsadon to be judged is Phraya Phahonphonphonphayuhasena, the former prime minister accused of having had republican sentiments and of wishing to use his position as head of government to try to abolish the monarchy.\nA crime of this kind would be considered a high treason not only against the king, but against the entire kingdom of Siam, and the death sentence seems to be the logical choice.\nBut we must not forget that he is also a very competent soldier and could very well find himself important for the future in view of the potential conflicts that are approaching...
siam.29.a코0=He Only Deserves Death
siam.29.b코0=We Still Need Him

siam.30.t코0=Trial Of Plaek Phibunsongkhram
siam.30.d코0=Plaek Phibunsongkhram is the second member of Khana Ratsadon to be tried, notably for his role in crushing Prince Bowodaret's rebellion, the first attempt to restore the King's authority, and for his participation in the defence of the city of Bangkok during Prince Dibabha's rebellion. He is therefore guilty of defending the Khana Ratsadon government, an act that can be considered treason against the monarchy. But one might wonder if he was not simply following the orders of the government of the day, and therefore would not have any moral problems following ours....

The Yes vote has won more than 80% of the vote, and sovereignty over these territories will be transferred to us. The government reassured France by guaranteeing that it would be entitled to economic benefits in the region

# Ideas
SIA_fascist_sympathies_in_the_army코0=Fascist Sympathies In The Army
SIA_fascist_sympathies_in_the_army_desc코0=Through the influence of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, fascist ideals have gained much ground within the army, accentuated by the authoritarian policy already in place.

SIA_civilian_wing_opposition코0=Civilian Wing Opposition
SIA_civilian_wing_opposition_desc코0=Since the 1932 revolution, the Khana Ratsadon, "People's Party", has been divided into two main wings, one civilian, in favour of democracy and social reforms, the other military, in favour of an expansion of the state, and a militarization of society.

# Focus
SIA_resist_the_governement코0=Resist Khana Ratsadon
SIA_resist_the_governement_desc코0=The Khana Ratsadon government is drifting more and more every day towards authoritarianism and nationalist and Jingoist rhetoric. Siam will never be a fascist nation, and the best way to make sure of that is to get rid of them!
SIA_the_democratic_cause코0=The Democratic Cause
SIA_the_democratic_cause_desc코0=The problem of our first revolution was that the military had far too much importance in it. By seeking to create a more civilian government, we will achieve the freedom and democracy that our people have been waiting for so long.
SIA_the_monarchist_cause코0=The Monarchist Cause
SIA_the_monarchist_cause_desc코0=Revolution, constitution... All this does not suit our nation. Wanting to change a system that worked perfectly was a bad decision, but there is still time to reverse its effects, starting by restoring the throne to Rama VII, legitimate king of Siam, who was forced to leave the country because of the military
SIA_write_a_new_constitution코0=Write a New Constitution
SIA_write_a_new_constitution_desc코0=A new constitution, ensuring much greater civilian control over the government, will be written in order to permanently rid itself of military influence on our legislation

Now that the latter has full control of the Republic, he is able to implement his reforms, and reform the economy to make it beneficial to the Siamese people
SIA_monitor_the_army코0=Monitoring the Army
SIA_monitor_the_army_desc코0=In order to ensure that the army never again takes power, we will implement major reforms, in particular the fact that soldiers obey the government before their generals, thereby reducing the influence of the latter.

SIA_denounce_fascism코0=Denounce Fascism
SIA_denounce_fascism_desc코0=Fascism is an ideology designed to opress and divide peoples. Many people in Khana Ratsadon had sympathies for these movements, and it is our duty to oppose any government wishing to cause its people the same suffering as we do.
SIA_negociations_with_france코0=Negotiations With France
SIA_negociations_with_france_desc코0=It is true that France was the nation that confronted us the most, and at the same time, humiliated us, particularly by making us lose Cambodia or Laos. But it was at the time of our absolute monarchy. We have changed, and we are ready to approach France in peace. In return, perhaps we will have the right to be reunited with our Laotian and Cambodian brothers?
SIA_boom_in_foreign_investments코0=Boom in Foreign Investments
SIA_boom_in_foreign_investments_desc코0=Our diplomatic manoeuvres have served us well, as the investments we receive have increased significantly, accentuated by the new stability of our regime. We are at the dawn of a new era for our economy!

SIA_the_british_military_mission_desc코0=We were able to negotiate the sending of a military delegation from the United Kingdom. Having people who have seen battlefields around the world as teachers for our soldiers will be a great asset.

SIA_supreme_council코0=Supreme Council of the State
SIA_supreme_council_desc코0=The Supreme Council of the State of Siam was a legislative council, which at the time was composed of princes of the Chakri dynasty, to assist Rama VII in his decisions.

SIA_consolidate_Khana_Ratsadon_desc코0=Despite many oppositions, Phraya Phahonphonphonphayuhasena's government has succeeded in consolidating its control of Siam. With its militaristic and one-party policy, Siam seems to be slowly slipping towards its own adaptation of European fascism or Japanese militarism
SIA_increase_the_artistic_propaganda코0=Increase The Artistic Propaganda
SIA_increase_the_artistic_propaganda_desc코0=For some years now, great efforts have been made at the cultural level to develop a nationalist spirit among our population. Films, theatre plays, everything is set up for the Thai people to develop a warrior spirit, and in return, we could well increase our number of recruits
SIA_weaken_the_civilian_wing코0=Weaken The Civilian Wing
SIA_weaken_the_civilian_wing_desc코0=The civilian wing of the party has only been another obstacle on our path, denouncing the strong military presence and wishing for a more pacifist foreign policy.

SIA_fate_of_the_monarchy코0=Fate Of the Monarchy
SIA_fate_of_the_monarchy_desc코0=Many remember Rama VII's protests against the government, which ultimately led him into exile.

SIA_phibun_ascension코0=Phibun's Ascension
SIA_phibun_ascension_desc코0=Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, former Minister of Defence and therefore number two in the government, seems to be well placed to lead our nation.

SIA_pan_thai_propaganda코0=Maha Anachak Thai
SIA_pan_thai_propaganda_desc코0=Maha Anachak Thai, meaning "Great Thai Empire", is a concept mainly developed by Luang Wichitwathakan, a loyal ally of Phibun, and a nationalist and irredentist ideologue.

SIA_economic_nationalism코0=Economic Nationalism
SIA_economic_nationalism_desc코0=We must achieve economic self-sufficiency, and get rid of Chinese capital, a sign of dependence on a people that is not our own. Taxes on commercial profits will be increased, and state-owned companies, particularly those related to armaments, will be introduced.

SIA_prepare_for_the_reconquest_desc코0=A great effort will have to be made by both the government and the Thai people to prepare for the reconquest of our territories that we lost decades ago. Huge propaganda for work in the military industry or in the military career will be deployed to ensure that we are ready to go to war
SIA_choosing_a_side코0=Choosing A Side
SIA_choosing_a_side_desc코0=In order to defeat the imperialist powers, we will need allies with the same objectives as us. To the east is Japan, which has the advantage of being close and having a fleet capable of competing with that of the Brittanics, and to the west is Germany, a country that Phibun has never ceased to admire, but located very far from us. Some minority members have tried to say that we do not need alliances, and that mental preparation is all we need, but the chances of them being listened to are low, but not non-existent...
SIA_increase_the_military_budget코0=Increase The Military Budget

SIA_massive_land_reforms_desc코0=For centuries, peasants have suffered from feudal systems, where the land they cultivate did not even belong to them. We will correct this injustice by nationalizing the land and redistributing it equitably to those who cultivate it.
SIA_finding_allies코0=Finding Allies
SIA_finding_allies_desc코0=In order to complete a revolution in Asia and then in the world, we need to seek the support of other communist nations, in particular the Soviet Union, long seen as the birthplace and bastion of the revolution.

SIA_remove_the_monarchist_system_desc코0=The decadent monarchist system is a symbol of the oppression of the Siamese people, who for so long had to meet the expectations of a leader whose only merit was to have been born into a royal family.
